<p>“The reasonings about the wonderful and intricate operations
of nature are so full of uncertainty, that, as the Wise-man truly
observes, <i>hardly do we guess aright at the things that are upon
earth, and with labour do we find the things that are before us</i>.”
Stephen Hales, <i>Vegetable Staticks</i> (1727), p. 318, 1738.</p></div>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="h2herein" title="Prefatory Note.">PREFATORY NOTE</h2>

<p class="pfirst">This
book of mine has little need of preface, for indeed it is
“all preface” from beginning to end. I have written it as
an easy introduction to the study of organic Form, by methods
which are the common-places of physical science, which are by
no means novel in their application to natural history, but which
nevertheless naturalists are little accustomed to employ.</p></div>

<p>It is not the biologist with an inkling of mathematics, but
the skilled and learned mathematician who must ultimately
deal with such problems as are merely sketched and adumbrated
here. I pretend to no math­e­mat­i­cal skill, but I have made what
use I could of what tools I had; I have dealt with simple cases,
and the math­e­mat­i­cal methods which I have introduced are of
the easiest and simplest kind. Elementary as they are, my book
has not been written without the help—the indispensable help—of
many friends. Like Mr Pope translating Homer, when I felt
myself deficient I sought assistance! And the experience which
Johnson attributed to Pope has been mine also, that men of
learning did not refuse to help me.</p>

<p>My debts are many, and I will not try to proclaim them all:
but I beg to record my particular obligations to Professor Claxton
Fidler, Sir George Greenhill, Sir Joseph Larmor, and Professor
A. McKenzie; to a much younger but very helpful friend,
Mr John Marshall, Scholar of Trinity; lastly, and (if I may say
so) most of all, to my colleague Professor William Peddie, whose
advice has made many useful additions to my book and whose
criticism has spared me many a fault and blunder.</p>

<p>I am under obligations also to the authors and publishers of
many books from which illustrations have been borrowed, and
especially to the following:―</p>

<p>To the Controller of H.M. Stationery Office, for leave to
reproduce a number of figures, chiefly of Foraminifera and of
Radiolaria, from the Reports of the Challenger Expedition.
<span class="xxpn">{vi}</span></p>

<p>To the Council of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and to that
of the Zoological Society of London:—the former for letting me
reprint from their <i>Transactions</i> the greater part of the text and
illustrations of my concluding chapter, the latter for the use of a
number of figures for my chapter on Horns.</p>

<p>To Professor E. B. Wilson, for his well-known and all but
indispensable figures of the cell (figs. <a href="#fig42"
title="go to Fig. 42">42</a>–<a href="#fig51" title="go to Fig. 51">51</a>,
<a href="#fig53" title="go to Fig. 53">53</a>); to M. A. Prenant,
for other figures (<a href="#fig41" title="go to Fig. 41">41</a>,
<a href="#fig48" title="go to Fig. 48">48</a>) in the same chapter; to Sir Donald
MacAlister and Mr Edwin Arnold for certain figures
(<a href="#fig335" title="go to Fig. 335">335</a>–<a href="#fig337"
title="go to Fig. 337">7</a>),
and to Sir Edward Schäfer and Messrs Longmans for another
(<a href="#fig334" title="go to Fig. 334">334</a>),
illustrating the minute trabecular structure of bone. To Mr
Gerhard Heilmann, of Copenhagen, for his beautiful diagrams
(figs. <a href="#fig388" title="go to Fig. 388">388</a>–<a
 href="#fig393" title="go to Fig. 393">93</a>,
 <a href="#fig401" title="go to Fig. 401">401</a>,
 <a href="#fig402" title="go to Fig. 402">402</a>) included in my last chapter. To Professor
Claxton Fidler and to Messrs Griffin, for letting me use,
with more or less modification or simplification, a number of
illustrations (figs.
 <a href="#fig339" title="go to Fig. 339">339</a>–<a href="#fig346" title="go to Fig. 346">346</a>)
from Professor Fidler’s <i>Textbook of
Bridge Construction</i>. To Messrs Blackwood and Sons, for several
cuts (figs.
 <a href="#fig127" title="go to Fig. 127">127</a>–<a href="#fig9" title="go to Fig. 9">9</a>,
 <a href="#fig131" title="go to Fig. 131">131</a>,
 <a href="#fig173" title="go to Fig. 173">173</a>) from Professor Alleyne Nicholson’s
<i>Palaeontology</i>; to Mr Heinemann, for certain figures
(<a href="#fig57" title="go to Fig. 57">57</a>,
 <a href="#fig122" title="go to Fig. 122">122</a>,
 <a href="#fig123" title="go to Fig. 123">123</a>,
<a href="#fig205" title="go to Fig. 205">205</a>) from Dr Stéphane Leduc’s <i>Mechanism of Life</i>; to Mr A. M.
Worthington and to Messrs Longmans, for figures
 (<a href="#fig71" title="go to Fig. 71">71</a>,
 <a href="#fig75" title="go to Fig. 75">75</a>) from
<i>A Study of Splashes</i>, and to Mr C. R. Darling and to Messrs E.
and S. Spon for those (fig.
 <a href="#fig85" title="go to Fig. 85">85</a>) from Mr Darling’s <i>Liquid Drops
and Globules</i>. To Messrs Macmillan and Co. for two figures
(<a href="#fig304" title="go to Fig. 304">304</a>,
 <a href="#fig305" title="go to Fig. 305">305</a>) from Zittel’s <i>Palaeontology</i>, to the Oxford University
Press for a diagram (fig.
 <a href="#fig28" title="go to Fig. 28">28</a>) from Mr J. W. Jenkinson’s <i>Experimental
Embryology</i>; and to the Cambridge University Press for
a number of figures from Professor Henry Woods’s <i>Invertebrate
Palaeontology</i>, for one (fig.
 <a href="#fig210" title="go to Fig. 210">210</a>) from Dr Willey’s <i>Zoological Results</i>,
and for another (fig.
 <a href="#fig321" title="go to Fig. 321">321</a>) from “Thomson and Tait.”</p>

<div class="dkeeptgth">
<p>Many more, and by much the greater part of my diagrams,

INTRODUCTORY</span></h2></div>

<p>Of the chemistry of his day and generation, Kant declared
that it was “a science, but not science,”—“eine Wissenschaft,
aber nicht Wissenschaft”; for that the criterion of physical
science lay in its relation to mathematics. And a hundred years
later Du Bois Reymond, profound student of the many sciences
on which physiology is based, recalled and reiterated the old
saying, declaring that chemistry would only reach the rank of
science, in the high and strict sense, when it should be found
possible to explain chemical reactions in the light of their causal
relation to the velocities, tensions and conditions of equi­lib­rium
of the component molecules; that, in short, the chemistry of the
future must deal with molecular mechanics, by the methods and
in the strict language of mathematics, as the astronomy of Newton
and Laplace dealt with the stars in their courses. We know how
great a step has been made towards this distant and once hopeless
goal, as Kant defined it, since van’t Hoff laid the firm foundations
of a math­e­mat­i­cal chemistry, and earned his proud epitaph,
<i>Physicam chemiae adiunxit</i>&#xfeff;<a class="afnanch" href="#fn1" id="fnanch1">1</a>.</p>

<p>We need not wait for the full realisation of Kant’s desire, in
order to apply to the natural sciences the principle which he
urged. Though chemistry fall short of its ultimate goal in math­e­mat­i­cal
mechanics, nevertheless physiology is vastly strengthened
and enlarged by making use of the chemistry, as of the physics,
of the age. Little by little it draws nearer to our conception of
a true science, with each branch of physical
science which it <span class="xxpn" id="p002">{2}</span>
brings into relation with itself: with every physical law and every
math­e­mat­i­cal theorem which it learns to take into its employ.
Between the physiology of Haller, fine as it was, and that of
Helmholtz, Ludwig, Claude Bernard, there was all the difference
in the world.</p>

<p>As soon as we adventure on the paths of the physicist, we
learn to <i>weigh</i> and to <i>measure</i>, to deal with time and space and
mass and their related concepts, and to find more and more
our knowledge expressed and our needs satisfied through the
concept of <i>number</i>, as in the dreams and visions of Plato and
Pythagoras; for modern chemistry would have gladdened the
hearts of those great philosophic dreamers.</p>

<p>But the zoologist or morphologist has been slow, where the
physiologist has long been eager, to invoke the aid of the physical
or math­e­mat­i­cal sciences; and the reasons for this difference lie
deep, and in part are rooted in old traditions. The zoologist has
scarce begun to dream of defining, in math­e­mat­i­cal language, even
the simpler organic forms. When he finds a simple geometrical
construction, for instance in the honey-comb, he would fain refer
it to psychical instinct or design rather than to the operation of
physical forces; when he sees in snail, or nautilus, or tiny
foraminiferal or radiolarian shell, a close approach to the perfect
sphere or spiral, he is prone, of old habit, to believe that it is
after all something more than a spiral or a sphere, and that in
this “something more” there lies what neither physics nor
mathematics can explain. In short he is deeply reluctant to
compare the living with the dead, or to explain by geometry or
by dynamics the things which have their part in the mystery of
life. Moreover he is little inclined to feel the need of such
explanations or of such extension of his field of thought. He is
not without some justification if he feels that in admiration of
nature’s handiwork he has an horizon open before his eyes as
wide as any man requires. He has the help of many fascinating
theories within the bounds of his own science, which, though
a little lacking in precision, serve the purpose of ordering his
thoughts and of suggesting new objects of enquiry. His art of
clas­si­fi­ca­tion becomes a ceaseless and an endless search after the
blood-relationships of things living, and the
pedigrees of things <span class="xxpn" id="p003">{3}</span>
dead and gone. The facts of embryology become for him, as
Wolff, von Baer and Fritz Müller proclaimed, a record not only
of the life-history of the individual but of the annals of its race.
The facts of geographical distribution or even of the migration of
birds lead on and on to speculations regarding lost continents,
sunken islands, or bridges across ancient seas. Every nesting
bird, every ant-hill or spider’s web displays its psychological
problems of instinct or intelligence. Above all, in things both
great and small, the naturalist is rightfully impressed, and finally
engrossed, by the peculiar beauty which is manifested in apparent
fitness or “adaptation,”—the flower for the bee, the berry for the
bird.</p>

<p>Time out of mind, it has been by way of the “final cause,”
by the teleological concept of “end,” of “purpose,” or of “design,”
in one or another of its many forms (for its moods are many),
that men have been chiefly wont to explain the phenomena of
the living world; and it will be so while men have eyes to see
and ears to hear withal. With Galen, as with Aristotle, it was
the physician’s way; with John Ray, as with Aristotle, it was the
naturalist’s way; with Kant, as with Aristotle, it was the philosopher’s
way. It was the old Hebrew way, and has its splendid
setting in the story that God made “every plant of the field before
it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew.”
It is a common way, and a great way; for it brings with it a
glimpse of a great vision, and it lies deep as the love of nature
in the hearts of men.</p>

<p>Half overshadowing the “efficient” or physical cause, the
argument of the final cause appears in eighteenth century physics,
in the hands of such men as Euler<a class="afnanch" href="#fn2" id="fnanch2">2</a>
and Maupertuis, to whom
Leibniz<a class="afnanch" href="#fn3" id="fnanch3">3</a>
had passed it on. Half overshadowed by the mechanical
concept, it runs through Claude Bernard’s <i>Leçons
sur les <span class="xxpn" id="p004">{4}</span>
phénomènes de la Vie</i><a class="afnanch" href="#fn4" id="fnanch4">4</a>,
and abides in much of modern physiology<a class="afnanch" href="#fn5" id="fnanch5">5</a>.
Inherited from Hegel, it dominated Oken’s <i>Naturphilosophie</i>
and lingered among his later disciples, who were wont to liken
the course of organic evolution not to the straggling branches of
a tree, but to the building of a temple, divinely planned, and the
crowning of it with its polished minarets<a class="afnanch" href="#fn6" id="fnanch6">6</a>.</p>

<p>It is retained, somewhat crudely, in modern embryology, by
those who see in the early processes of growth a significance
“rather prospective than retrospective,” such that the embryonic
phenomena must be “referred directly to their usefulness in
building the body of the future animal<a class="afnanch" href="#fn7" id="fnanch7">7</a>”:—which
is no more, and
no less, than to say, with Aristotle, that the organism is the τέλος,
or final cause, of its own processes of generation and development.
It is writ large in that Entelechy<a class="afnanch" href="#fn8" id="fnanch8">8</a>
which Driesch rediscovered,
and which he made known to many who had neither learned of it
from Aristotle, nor studied it with Leibniz, nor laughed at it with
Voltaire. And, though it is in a very curious way, we are told that
teleology was “refounded, reformed or rehabilitated<a class="afnanch" href="#fn9" id="fnanch9">9</a>”
by Darwin’s
theory of natural selection, whereby “every variety of form and
colour was urgently and absolutely called upon to produce its
title to existence either as an active useful agent, or as a survival”
of such active usefulness in the past. But in this last, and very
important case, we have reached a “teleology”
without a τέλος, <span class="xxpn" id="p005">{5}</span>
as men like Butler and Janet have been prompt to shew: a teleology
in which the final cause becomes little more, if anything, than the
mere expression or resultant of a process of sifting out of the
good from the bad, or of the better from the worse, in short of
a process of mechanism<a class="afnanch" href="#fn10" id="fnanch10">10</a>.
The apparent manifestations of “purpose”
or adaptation become part of a mechanical philosophy,
according to which “chaque chose finit toujours par s’accommoder
à son milieu<a class="afnanch" href="#fn11" id="fnanch11">11</a>.”
In short, by a road which resembles but is not
the same as Maupertuis’s road, we find our way to the very world
in which we are living, and find that if it be not, it is ever tending
to become, “the best of all possible worlds<a class="afnanch" href="#fn12" id="fnanch12">12</a>.”</p>

<p>But the use of the teleological principle is but one way, not
the whole or the only way, by which we may seek to learn how
things came to be, and to take their places in the harmonious complexity
of the world. To seek not for ends but for “antecedents”
is the way of the physicist, who finds “causes” in what he has
learned to recognise as fundamental properties, or inseparable
concomitants, or unchanging laws, of matter and of energy. In
Aristotle’s parable, the house is there that men may live in it;
but it is also there because the builders have laid one stone upon
another: and it is as a <i>mechanism</i>, or a mechanical construction,
that the physicist looks upon the world. Like warp and woof,
mechanism and teleology are interwoven together, and we must
not cleave to the one and despise the other; for their union is
“rooted in the very nature of totality<a class="afnanch" href="#fn13" id="fnanch13">13</a>.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when philosophy bids us hearken and obey the
lessons both of mechanical and of teleological interpretation, the
precept is hard to follow: so that oftentimes it has come to pass,
just as in Bacon’s day, that a leaning to the side of the final
cause “hath intercepted the severe and diligent
inquiry of all <span class="xxpn" id="p006">{6}</span>
real and physical causes,” and has brought it about that “the
search of the physical cause hath been neglected and passed in
silence.” So long and so far as “fortuitous variation<a class="afnanch" href="#fn14" id="fnanch14">14</a>”
and the
“survival of the fittest” remain engrained as fundamental and
satisfactory hypotheses in the philosophy of biology, so long will
these “satisfactory and specious causes” tend to stay “severe and
diligent inquiry,” “to the great arrest and prejudice of future
discovery.”</p>

<p>The difficulties which surround the concept of active or “real”
causation, in Bacon’s sense of the word, difficulties of which
Hume and Locke and Aristotle were little aware, need scarcely
hinder us in our physical enquiry. As students of math­e­mat­i­cal
and of empirical physics, we are content to deal with those antecedents,
or concomitants, of our phenomena, without which the
phenomenon does not occur,—with causes, in short, which, <i>aliae
ex aliis aptae et necessitate nexae</i>, are no more, and no less, than
conditions <i>sine quâ non</i>. Our purpose is still adequately fulfilled:
inasmuch as we are still enabled to correlate, and to equate, our
particular phenomena with more and ever more of the physical
phenomena around, and so to weave a web of connection and
interdependence which shall serve our turn, though the metaphysician
withhold from that interdependence the title of causality.
We come in touch with what the schoolmen called a <i>ratio
cognoscendi</i>, though the true <i>ratio efficiendi</i> is still enwrapped in
many mysteries. And so handled, the quest of physical causes
merges with another great Aristotelian theme,—the search for
relations between things apparently disconnected, and for “similitude
in things to common view unlike.” Newton did not shew
the cause of the apple falling, but he shewed a similitude between
the apple and the stars.</p>

<p>Moreover, the naturalist and the physicist will continue to
speak of “causes,” just as of old, though it may be with some
mental reservations: for, as a French philosopher said, in a
kindred difficulty: “ce sont là des
manières de s’exprimer, <span class="xxpn" id="p007">{7}</span>
et si elles sont interdites il faut renoncer à parler de ces
choses.”</p>

<p>The search for differences or essential contrasts between the
phenomena of organic and inorganic, of animate and inanimate
things has occupied many mens’ minds, while the search for
community of principles, or essential similitudes, has been followed
by few; and the contrasts are apt to loom too large, great as
they may be. M. Dunan, discussing the “Problème de la Vie<a class="afnanch" href="#fn15" id="fnanch15">15</a>”
in an essay which M. Bergson greatly commends, declares: “Les
lois physico-chimiques sont aveugles et brutales; là où elles
règnent seules, au lieu d’un ordre et d’un concert, il ne peut y
avoir qu’incohérence et chaos.” But the physicist proclaims
aloud that the physical phenomena which meet us by the way
have their manifestations of form, not less beautiful and scarce
less varied than those which move us to admiration among living
things. The waves of the sea, the little ripples on the shore, the
sweeping curve of the sandy bay between its headlands, the
outline of the hills, the shape of the clouds, all these are so many
riddles of form, so many problems of morphology, and all of
them the physicist can more or less easily read and adequately
solve: solving them by reference to their antecedent phenomena,
in the material system of mechanical forces to which they belong,
and to which we interpret them as being due. They have also,
doubtless, their <i>immanent</i> teleological significance; but it is on
another plane of thought from the physicist’s that we contemplate
their intrinsic harmony and perfection, and “see that they are
good.”</p>

<p>Nor is it otherwise with the material forms of living things.
Cell and tissue, shell and bone, leaf and flower, are so many
portions of matter, and it is in obedience to the laws of physics
that their particles have been moved,
moulded and conformed<a class="afnanch" href="#fn16" id="fnanch16">16</a>.
<span class="xxpn" id="p008">{8}</span>
They are no exception to the rule that Θεὸς ἀεὶ γεωμετρεῖ. Their
problems of form are in the first instance math­e­mat­i­cal problems,
and their problems of growth are essentially physical problems;
and the morphologist is, <i>ipso facto</i>, a student of physical science.</p>

<p>Apart from the physico-chemical problems of modern physiology,
the road of physico-math­e­mat­i­cal or dynamical in­ves­ti­ga­tion
in morphology has had few to follow it; but the pathway is old.
The way of the old Ionian physicians, of Anaxagoras<a class="afnanch" href="#fn17" id="fnanch17">17</a>,
of
Empedocles and his disciples in the days before Aristotle, lay
just by that highwayside. It was Galileo’s and Borelli’s way.
It was little trodden for long afterwards, but once in a while
Swammerdam and Réaumur looked that way. And of later
years, Moseley and Meyer, Berthold, Errera and Roux have
been among the little band of travellers. We need not wonder
if the way be hard to follow, and if these wayfarers have yet
gathered little. A harvest has been reaped by others, and the
gleaning of the grapes is slow.</p>

<p>It behoves us always to remember that in physics it has taken
great men to discover simple things. They are very great names
indeed that we couple with the explanation of the path of a stone,
the droop of a chain, the tints of a bubble, the shadows in a cup.
It is but the slightest adumbration of a dynamical morphology
that we can hope to have, until the physicist and the mathematician
shall have made these problems of ours their own, or till a new
Boscovich shall have written for the naturalist the new <i>Theoria
Philosophiae Naturalis</i>.</p>

<p>How far, even then, mathematics will <i>suffice</i> to describe, and
physics to explain, the fabric of the body no man can foresee.
It may be that all the laws of energy, and all the properties of
matter, and all the chemistry of all the colloids are as powerless
to explain the body as they are impotent to comprehend the
soul. For my part, I think it is not so. Of how it is that the
soul informs the body, physical science teaches me nothing:
consciousness is not explained to my comprehension by all the
nerve-paths and “neurones” of the physiologist; nor do I ask of
physics how goodness shines in one man’s face, and evil betrays
itself in another. But of the construction and
growth and working <span class="xxpn" id="p009">{9}</span>
of the body, as of all that is of the earth earthy, physical science
is, in my humble opinion, our only teacher and guide<a class="afnanch" href="#fn18" id="fnanch18">18</a>.</p>

<p>Often and often it happens that our physical knowledge is
inadequate to explain the mechanical working of the organism;
the phenomena are superlatively complex, the procedure is
involved and entangled, and the in­ves­ti­ga­tion has occupied but
a few short lives of men. When physical science falls short of
explaining the order which reigns throughout these manifold
phenomena,—an order more char­ac­ter­is­tic in its totality than any
of its phenomena in themselves,—men hasten to invoke a guiding
principle, an entelechy, or call it what you will. But all the while,
so far as I am aware, no physical law, any more than that of
gravity itself, not even among the puzzles of chemical “stereometry,”
or of physiological “surface-action” or “osmosis,” is
known to be <i>transgressed</i> by the bodily mechanism.</p>

<p>Some physicists declare, as Maxwell did, that atoms or molecules
more complicated by far than the chemist’s hypotheses
demand are requisite to explain the phenomena of life. If what
is implied be an explanation of psychical phenomena, let the
point be granted at once; we may go yet further, and decline,
with Maxwell, to believe that anything of the nature of <i>physical</i>
complexity, however exalted, could ever suffice. Other physicists,
like Auerbach<a class="afnanch" href="#fn19" id="fnanch19">19</a>,
or Larmor<a class="afnanch" href="#fn20" id="fnanch20">20</a>,
or Joly<a class="afnanch" href="#fn21" id="fnanch21">21</a>,
assure us that our laws of
thermodynamics do not suffice, or are “inappropriate,” to explain
the maintenance or (in Joly’s phrase) the
“accelerative absorption” <span class="xxpn" id="p010">{10}</span>
of the bodily energies, and the long battle against the cold and
darkness which is death. With these weighty problems I am not
for the moment concerned. My sole purpose is to correlate with
math­e­mat­i­cal statement and physical law certain of the simpler
outward phenomena of organic growth and structure or form:
while all the while regarding, <i>ex hypothesi</i>, for the purposes of
this correlation, the fabric of the organism as a material and
mechanical configuration.</p>

<p>Physical science and philosophy stand side by side, and one upholds the
other. Without something of the strength of physics, philosophy would
be weak; and without something of philosophy’s wealth, physical science
would be poor. “Rien ne retirera du tissu de la science les fils d’or
que la main du philosophe y a
introduits<a class="afnanch" href="#fn22" id="fnanch22">22</a>.”
But there are fields
where each, for a while at least, must work alone; and where physical
science reaches its limitations, physical science itself must help us
to discover. Meanwhile the appropriate and legitimate postulate of the
physicist, in approaching the physical problems of the body, is that
with these physical phenomena no alien influence interferes. But the
postulate, though it is certainly legitimate, and though it is the
proper and necessary prelude to scientific enquiry, may some day be
proven to be untrue; and its disproof will not be to the physicist’s
confusion, but will come as his reward. In dealing with forms which are
so concomitant with life that they are seemingly controlled by life, it
is in no spirit of arrogant assertiveness that the physicist begins his
argument, after the fashion of a most illustrious exemplar, with the
old formulary of scholastic challenge,—<i>An Vita sit? Dico quod non.</i></p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The terms Form and Growth, which make up the title of this little
book, are to be understood, as I need hardly say, in their relation
to the science of organisms. We want to see how, in some cases at
least, the forms of living things, and of the parts of living things,
can be explained by physical con­si­de­ra­tions, and to realise that, in
general, no organic forms exist save such as are in conformity with
ordinary physical laws. And while growth is a somewhat vague word for a
complex matter, which may <span class="xxpn" id="p011">{11}</span>
depend on various things, from simple
imbibition of water to the complicated results of the chemistry of
nutrition, it deserves to be studied in relation to form, whether it
proceed by simple increase of size without obvious alteration of form,
or whether it so proceed as to bring about a gradual change of form and
the slow development of a more or less complicated structure.</p>

<p>In the Newtonian language of elementary physics, force is
recognised by its action in producing or in changing motion, or
in preventing change of motion or in maintaining rest. When we
deal with matter in the concrete, force does not, strictly speaking,
enter into the question, for force, unlike matter, has no independent
objective existence. It is energy in its various forms, known or
unknown, that acts upon matter. But when we abstract our
thoughts from the material to its form, or from the thing moved
to its motions, when we deal with the subjective conceptions of
form, or movement, or the movements that change of form implies,
then force is the appropriate term for our conception of the causes
by which these forms and changes of form are brought about.
When we use the term force, we use it, as the physicist always
does, for the sake of brevity, using a symbol for the magnitude
and direction of an action in reference to the symbol or diagram
of a material thing. It is a term as subjective and symbolic as
form itself, and so is appropriately to be used in connection
therewith.</p>

<p>The form, then, of any portion of matter, whether it be living
or dead, and the changes of form that are apparent in its movements
and in its growth, may in all cases alike be described as due to
the action of force. In short, the form of an object is a “diagram
of forces,” in this sense, at least, that from it we can judge of or
deduce the forces that are acting or have acted upon it: in this
strict and particular sense, it is a diagram,—in the case of a solid,
of the forces that <i>have</i> been impressed upon it when its conformation
was produced, together with those that enable it to retain its
conformation; in the case of a liquid (or of a gas) of the forces that
are for the moment acting on it to restrain or balance its own
inherent mobility. In an organism, great or small, it is not
merely the nature of the <i>motions</i> of the living substance that we
must interpret in terms of force (according to
kinetics), but also <span class="xxpn" id="p012">{12}</span>
the <i>conformation</i> of the organism itself, whose permanence or
equi­lib­rium is explained by the interaction or balance of forces,
as described in statics.</p>

<p>If we look at the living cell of an Amoeba or a Spirogyra, we
see a something which exhibits certain active movements, and
a certain fluctuating, or more or less lasting, form; and its form
at a given moment, just like its motions, is to be investigated by
the help of physical methods, and explained by the invocation of
the math­e­mat­i­cal conception of force.</p>

<p>Now the state, including the shape or form, of a portion of
matter, is the resultant of a number of forces, which represent or
symbolise the manifestations of various kinds of energy; and it
is obvious, accordingly, that a great part of physical science must
be understood or taken for granted as the necessary preliminary
to the discussion on which we are engaged. But we may at
least try to indicate, very briefly, the nature of the principal
forces and the principal properties of matter with which our
subject obliges us to deal. Let us imagine, for instance, the case
of a so-called “simple” organism, such as <i>Amoeba</i>; and if our
short list of its physical properties and conditions be helpful
to our further discussion, we need not consider how far it
be complete or adequate from the wider physical point of
view<a class="afnanch" href="#fn23" id="fnanch23">23</a>.</p>

<p>This portion of matter, then, is kept together by the intermolecular
force of cohesion; in the movements of its particles
relatively to one another, and in its own movements relative to
adjacent matter, it meets with the opposing force of friction.
It is acted on by gravity, and this force tends (though slightly,
owing to the Amoeba’s small mass, and to the small difference
between its density and that of the surrounding fluid), to flatten
it down upon the solid substance on which it may be creeping.
Our Amoeba tends, in the next place, to be deformed by any
pressure from outside, even though slight, which may be applied
to it, and this circumstance shews it to consist of matter in a
fluid, or at least semi-fluid, state: which state is further indicated
when we observe streaming or current motions in its interior. <span class="xxpn" id="p013">{13}</span>
Like other fluid bodies, its surface, whatsoever other substance,
gas, liquid or solid, it be in contact with, and in varying degree
according to the nature of that adjacent substance, is the seat
of molecular force exhibiting itself as a surface-tension, from the
action of which many important consequences follow, which
greatly affect the form of the fluid surface.</p>

<p>While the protoplasm of the Amoeba reacts to the slightest
pressure, and tends to “flow,” and while we therefore speak of it
as a fluid, it is evidently far less mobile than such a fluid, for
instance, as water, but is rather like treacle in its slow creeping
movements as it changes its shape in response to force. Such
fluids are said to have a high viscosity, and this viscosity obviously
acts in the way of retarding change of form, or in other words
of retarding the effects of any disturbing action of force. When
the viscous fluid is capable of being drawn out into fine threads,
a property in which we know that the material of some Amoebae
differs greatly from that of others, we say that the fluid is also
<i>viscid</i>, or exhibits viscidity. Again, not by virtue of our Amoeba
being liquid, but at the same time in vastly greater measure than if it
were a solid (though far less rapidly than if it were a gas), a process
of molecular diffusion is constantly going on within its substance,
by which its particles interchange their places within the mass,
while surrounding fluids, gases and solids in solution diffuse into
and out of it. In so far as the outer wall of the cell is different
in character from the interior, whether it be a mere pellicle as
in Amoeba or a firm cell-wall as in Protococcus, the diffusion
which takes place <i>through</i> this wall is sometimes distinguished
under the term <i>osmosis</i>.</p>

<p>Within the cell, chemical forces are at work, and so also in
all probability (to judge by analogy) are electrical forces; and
the organism reacts also to forces from without, that have their
origin in chemical, electrical and thermal influences. The processes
of diffusion and of chemical activity within the cell result,
by the drawing in of water, salts, and food-material with or without
chemical transformation into protoplasm, in growth, and this
complex phenomenon we shall usually, without discussing its
nature and origin, describe and picture as a <i>force</i>. Indeed we
shall manifestly be inclined to use the term growth
in two senses, <span class="xxpn" id="p014">{14}</span>
just indeed as we do in the case of attraction or gravitation,
on the one hand as a <i>process</i>, and on the other hand as a
<i>force</i>.</p>

<p>In the phenomena of cell-division, in the attractions or repulsions
of the parts of the dividing nucleus and in the “caryokinetic”
figures that appear in connection with it, we seem to see in operation
forces and the effects of forces, that have, to say the least of
it, a close analogy with known physical phenomena; and to this
matter we shall afterwards recur. But though they resemble
known physical phenomena, their nature is still the subject of
much discussion, and neither the forms produced nor the forces
at work can yet be satisfactorily and simply explained. We may
readily admit, then, that besides phenomena which are obviously
physical in their nature, there are actions visible as well as
invisible taking place within living cells which our knowledge
does not permit us to ascribe with certainty to any known physical
force; and it may or may not be that these phenomena will yield
in time to the methods of physical in­ves­ti­ga­tion. Whether or
no, it is plain that we have no clear rule or guide as to what is
“vital” and what is not; the whole assemblage of so-called vital
phenomena, or properties of the organism, cannot be clearly
classified into those that are physical in origin and those that are
<i>sui generis</i> and peculiar to living things. All we can do meanwhile
is to analyse, bit by bit, those parts of the whole to which the
ordinary laws of the physical forces more or less obviously and
clearly and indubitably apply.</p>

<p>Morphology then is not only a study of material things and
of the forms of material things, but has its dynamical aspect,
under which we deal with the interpretation, in terms of force,
of the operations of Energy. And here it is well worth while
to remark that, in dealing with the facts of embryology or the
phenomena of inheritance, the common language of the books
seems to deal too much with the <i>material</i> elements concerned, as
the causes of development, of variation or of hereditary transmission.
Matter as such produces nothing, changes nothing, does
nothing; and however convenient it may afterwards be to abbreviate
our nomenclature and our descriptions, we must most
carefully realise in the outset that the
spermatozoon, the nucleus, <span class="xxpn" id="p015">{15}</span>
the chromosomes or the germ-plasm can never <i>act</i> as matter alone,
but only as seats of energy and as centres of force. And this is but
an adaptation (in the light, or rather in the conventional symbolism,
of modern physical science) of the old saying of the philosopher:
ἀρχὴ γὰρ ἡ φύσις μᾶλλον τῆς ὕλης.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="p016">
<h2 class="h2herein" title="II. On Magnitude.">CHAPTER II.
<span class="h2ttl">
ON MAGNITUDE</span></h2></div>

<p>To terms of magnitude, and of direction, must we refer all
our conceptions of form. For the form of an object is defined
when we know its magnitude, actual or relative, in various
directions; and growth involves the same conceptions of magnitude
and direction, with this addition, that they are supposed to alter
in time. Before we proceed to the consideration of specific form,
it will be worth our while to consider, for a little while, certain
phenomena of spatial magnitude, or of the extension of a body
in the several dimensions of space<a class="afnanch" href="#fn24" id="fnanch24">24</a>.</p>

<p>We are taught by elementary mathematics that, in similar
solid figures, the surface increases as the square, and
the volume as the cube, of the linear dimensions. If we
take the simple case of a sphere, with radius <i>r</i>, the
area of its surface is equal to 4π<i>r</i>&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup>&#x202f;, and its volume to
(&#xfeff;<sup>4</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>3</sub>)π<i>r</i>&#xfeff;<sup>3</sup>&#x2009;; from which it follows that the ratio of volume
to surface, or
<sup class="spitc">V</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub class="spitc">S</sub>&#x202f;, is
(<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>3</sub>)<i>r</i>.
In other words, the
greater the radius (or the larger the sphere) the greater
will be its volume, or its mass (if it be uniformly dense
throughout), in comparison with its superficial area. And,
taking <i>L</i> to represent any linear dimension, we may write
the general equations in the form</p>

<div class="dmaths">

<p>From these elementary principles a great number of consequences
follow, all more or less interesting, and some of them of
great importance. In the first place, though growth in length
(let <span class="xxpn" id="p017">{17}</span>
us say) and growth in volume (which is usually tantamount to
mass or weight) are parts of one and the same process or phenomenon,
the one attracts our <i>attention</i> by its increase, very much
more than the other. For instance a fish, in doubling its length,
multiplies its weight by no less than eight times; and it all but
doubles its weight in growing from four inches long to five.</p>

<p>In the second place we see that a knowledge of the correlation
between length and weight in any particular species of animal,
in other words a determination of <i>k</i> in the
formula <i>W</i>
=&#x202f;<i>k&#x202f;·&#x202f;L</i>&#xfeff;<sup>3</sup>&#x202f;,
enables us at any time to translate the one magnitude into the
other, and (so to speak) to weigh the animal with a measuring-rod;
this however being always subject to the condition that the
animal shall in no way have altered its form, nor its specific
gravity. That its specific gravity or density should materially or
rapidly alter is not very likely; but as long as growth lasts,
changes of form, even though inappreciable to the eye, are likely
to go on. Now weighing is a far easier and far more accurate
operation than measuring; and the measurements which would
reveal slight and otherwise imperceptible changes in the form of
a fish—slight relative differences between length, breadth and
depth, for instance,—would need to be very delicate indeed. But
if we can make fairly accurate determinations of the length,
which is very much the easiest dimension to measure, and then
correlate it with the weight, then the value of <i>k</i>, according to
whether it varies or remains constant, will tell us at once whether
there has or has not been a tendency to gradual alteration in the
general form. To this subject we shall return, when we come to
consider more particularly the rate of growth.</p>

<p>But a much deeper interest arises out of this changing ratio
of dimensions when we come to consider the inevitable changes
of physical relations with which it is bound up. We are apt, and
even accustomed, to think that magnitude is so purely relative
that differences of magnitude make no other or more essential
difference; that Lilliput and Brobdingnag are all alike, according
as we look at them through one end of the glass or the other.
But this is by no means so; for <i>scale</i> has a very marked effect
upon physical phenomena, and the effect of scale constitutes what
is known as the principle of similitude, or
of dynamical similarity. <span class="xxpn" id="p018">{18}</span></p>

<p>This effect of scale is simply due to the fact that, of the physical
forces, some act either directly at the surface of a body, or otherwise
in <i>proportion</i> to the area of surface; and others, such as
gravity, act on all particles, internal and external alike, and exert
a force which is proportional to the mass, and so usually to the
volume, of the body.</p>

<p>The strength of an iron girder obviously varies with the
cross-section of its members, and each cross-section varies as the
square of a linear dimension; but the weight of the whole structure
varies as the cube of its linear dimensions. And it follows at once
that, if we build two bridges geometrically similar, the larger is
the weaker of the two<a class="afnanch" href="#fn25" id="fnanch25">25</a>.
It was elementary engineering experience
such as this that led Herbert Spencer<a class="afnanch" href="#fn26" id="fnanch26">26</a>
to apply the principle of
similitude to biology.</p>

<p>The same principle had been admirably applied, in a few clear
instances, by Lesage<a class="afnanch" href="#fn27" id="fnanch27">27</a>,
a celebrated eighteenth century physician
of Geneva, in an unfinished and unpublished work<a class="afnanch" href="#fn28" id="fnanch28">28</a>.
Lesage
argued, for instance, that the larger ratio of surface to mass would
lead in a small animal to excessive transpiration, were the skin
as “porous” as our own; and that we may hence account for
the hardened or thickened skins of insects and other small terrestrial
animals. Again, since the weight of a fruit increases as the cube
of its dimensions, while the strength of the stalk increases as the
square, it follows that the stalk should grow out of apparent due
proportion to the fruit; or alternatively, that tall trees should
not bear large fruit on slender branches, and that melons and
pumpkins must lie upon the ground. And again, that in quadrupeds
a large head must be supported on a neck
which is either <span class="xxpn" id="p019">{19}</span>
excessively thick and strong, like a bull’s, or very short like the
neck of an elephant.</p>

<p>But it was Galileo who, wellnigh 300 years ago, had first laid
down this general principle which we now know by the name of the
principle of similitude; and he did so with the utmost possible
clearness, and with a great wealth of illustration, drawn from
structures living and dead<a class="afnanch" href="#fn29" id="fnanch29">29</a>.
He showed that neither can man
build a house nor can nature construct an animal beyond a certain
size, while retaining the same proportions and employing the
same materials as sufficed in the case of a smaller structure<a class="afnanch" href="#fn30" id="fnanch30">30</a>.
The thing will fall to pieces of its own weight unless we either
change its relative proportions, which will at length cause it to
become clumsy, monstrous and inefficient, or else we must find
a new material, harder and stronger than was used before. Both
processes are familiar to us in nature and in art, and practical
applications, undreamed of by Galileo, meet us at every turn in
this modern age of steel.</p>

<p>Again, as Galileo was also careful to explain, besides the
questions of pure stress and strain, of the strength of muscles to
lift an increasing weight or of bones to resist its crushing stress,
we have the very important question of <i>bending moments</i>. This
question enters, more or less, into our whole range of problems;
it affects, as we shall afterwards see, or even determines the whole
form of the skeleton, and is very important in such a case as that
of a tall tree<a class="afnanch" href="#fn31" id="fnanch31">31</a>.</p>

<p>Here we have to determine the point at which the tree will
curve under its own weight, if it be ever so little displaced from
the perpendicular<a class="afnanch" href="#fn32" id="fnanch32">32</a>.
In such an in­ves­ti­ga­tion
we have to make <span class="xxpn" id="p020">{20}</span>
some assumptions,—for instance, with regard to the trunk, that
it tapers uniformly, and with regard to the branches that their
sectional area varies according to some definite law, or (as Ruskin
assumed<a class="afnanch" href="#fn33" id="fnanch33">33</a>)
tends to be constant in any horizontal plane; and the
math­e­mat­i­cal treatment is apt to be somewhat difficult. But
Greenhill has shewn that (on such assumptions as the above),
a certain British Columbian pine-tree, which yielded the Kew flagstaff
measuring 221 ft. in height with a diameter at the base of
21 inches, could not possibly, by theory, have grown to more
than about 300 ft. It is very curious that Galileo suggested
precisely the same height (<i>dugento braccia alta</i>) as the utmost
limit of the growth of a tree. In general, as Greenhill shews, the
diameter of a homogeneous body must increase as the power 3&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;2
of the height, which accounts for the slender proportions of young
trees, compared with the stunted appearance of old and large
ones<a class="afnanch" href="#fn34" id="fnanch34">34</a>.
In short, as Goethe says in <i>Wahrheit und Dichtung</i>, “Es
ist dafür gesorgt dass die Bäume nicht in den Himmel wachsen.”
But Eiffel’s great tree of steel (1000 feet high) is built to a
very different plan; for here the profile of the tower follows the
logarithmic curve, giving <i>equal strength</i> throughout, according
to a principle which we shall have occasion to discuss when we
come to treat of “form and mechanical efficiency” in connection
with the skeletons of animals.</p>

<p>Among animals, we may see in a general way, without the help
of mathematics or of physics, that exaggerated bulk brings with
it a certain clumsiness, a certain inefficiency, a new element of
risk and hazard, a vague preponderance of disadvantage. The
case was well put by Owen, in a passage which has an interest
of its own as a premonition (somewhat like De Candolle’s) of the
“struggle for existence.” Owen wrote as follows<a class="afnanch" href="#fn35" id="fnanch35">35</a>:
“In proportion
to the bulk of a species is the difficulty of the contest
which, as a living organised whole, the individual
of such species <span class="xxpn" id="p021">{21}</span>
has to maintain against the surrounding agencies that are ever
tending to dissolve the vital bond, and subjugate the living
matter to the ordinary chemical and physical forces. Any
changes, therefore, in such external conditions as a species may
have been originally adapted to exist in, will militate against that
existence in a degree proportionate, perhaps in a geometrical ratio,
to the bulk of the species. If a dry season be greatly prolonged,
the large mammal will suffer from the drought sooner than the
small one; if any alteration of climate affect the quantity of
vegetable food, the bulky Herbivore will first feel the effects of
stinted nourishment.”</p>

<p>But the principle of Galileo carries us much further and along
more certain lines.</p>

<p>The tensile strength of a muscle, like that of a rope or of our
girder, varies with its cross-section; and the resistance of a bone
to a crushing stress varies, again like our girder, with its cross-section.
But in a terrestrial animal the weight which tends to
crush its limbs or which its muscles have to move, varies as the
cube of its linear dimensions; and so, to the possible magnitude
of an animal, living under the direct action of gravity, there is
a definite limit set. The elephant, in the dimensions of its limb-bones,
is already shewing signs of a tendency to disproportionate
thickness as compared with the smaller mammals; its movements
are in many ways hampered and its agility diminished: it is
already tending towards the maximal limit of size which the
physical forces permit. But, as Galileo also saw, if the animal
be wholly immersed in water, like the whale, (or if it be partly
so, as was in all probability the case with the giant reptiles of our
secondary rocks), then the weight is counterpoised to the extent
of an equivalent volume of water, and is completely counterpoised
if the density of the animal’s body, with the included air, be
identical (as in a whale it very nearly is) with the water around.
Under these circumstances there is no longer a physical barrier
to the indefinite growth in magnitude of
the animal<a class="afnanch" href="#fn36" id="fnanch36">36</a>.
Indeed,
<span class="xxpn" id="p022">{22}</span>
in the case of the aquatic animal there is, as Spencer pointed out,
a distinct advantage, in that the larger it grows the greater is
its velocity. For its available energy depends on the mass of
its muscles; while its motion through the water is opposed, not
by gravity, but by “skin-friction,” which increases only as the
square of its dimensions; all other things being equal, the bigger
the ship, or the bigger the fish, the faster it tends to go, but only
in the ratio of the square root of the increasing length. For the
mechanical work (<i>W</i>) of which the fish is capable being proportional
to the mass of its muscles, or the cube of its linear
dimensions: and again this work being wholly done in producing
a velocity (<i>V</i>) against a resistance (<i>R</i>) which increases as the
square of the said linear dimensions; we have at once</p>

</div><!--dmaths-->

<p>But there is often another side to these questions, which makes
them too complicated to answer in a word. For instance, the
work (per stroke) of which two similar engines are capable should
obviously vary as the cubes of their linear dimensions, for it
varies on the one hand with the <i>surface</i> of the piston, and on the
other, with the <i>length</i> of the stroke; so is it likewise in the animal,
where the cor­re­spon­ding variation depends on the cross-section of
the muscle, and on the space through which it contracts. But
in two precisely similar engines, the actual available horse-power
varies as the square of the linear dimensions, and not as the
cube; and this for the obvious reason that the actual energy
developed depends upon the <i>heating-surface</i> of the
boiler<a class="afnanch" href="#fn37" id="fnanch37">37</a>.
So
likewise must there be a similar tendency, among animals, for the
rate of supply of kinetic energy to vary with
the surface of the <span class="xxpn" id="p023">{23}</span>
lung, that is to say (other things being equal) with the <i>square</i> of
the linear dimensions of the animal. We may of course (departing
from the condition of similarity) increase the heating-surface of
the boiler, by means of an internal system of tubes, without
increasing its outward dimensions, and in this very way nature
increases the respiratory surface of a lung by a complex system
of branching tubes and minute air-cells; but nevertheless in
two similar and closely related animals, as also in two steam-engines
of precisely the same make, the law is bound to hold that
the rate of working must tend to vary with the square of the
linear dimensions, according to Froude’s law of <i>steamship comparison</i>.
In the case of a very large ship, built for speed, the
difficulty is got over by increasing the size and number of the
boilers, till the ratio between boiler-room and engine-room is
far beyond what is required in an ordinary small vessel<a class="afnanch" href="#fn38" id="fnanch38">38</a>;
but
though we find lung-space increased among animals where
greater rate of working is required, as in general among birds,
I do not know that it can be shewn to increase, as in the
“over-boilered” ship, with the size of the animal, and in a ratio
which outstrips that of the other bodily dimensions. If it be the
case then, that the working mechanism of the muscles should be
able to exert a force proportionate to the cube of the linear
bodily dimensions, while the respiratory mechanism can only
supply a store of energy at a rate proportional to the square of
the said dimensions, the singular result ought to follow that, in
swimming for instance, the larger fish ought to be able to put on
a spurt of speed far in excess of the smaller one; but the distance
travelled by the year’s end should be very much alike for both
of them. And it should also follow that the
curve of fatigue <span class="xxpn" id="p024">{24}</span>
should be a steeper one, and the staying power should be
less, in the smaller than in the larger individual. This
is the case of long-distance racing, where the big winner
puts on his big spurt at the end. And for an analogous
reason, wise men know that in the ’Varsity boat-race it is
judicious and prudent to bet on the heavier crew.</p>

<p>Leaving aside the question of the supply of energy, and keeping
to that of the mechanical efficiency of the machine, we may find
endless biological illustrations of the principle of similitude.</p>

<p>In the case of the flying bird (apart from the initial difficulty of
raising itself into the air, which involves another problem) it may
be shewn that the bigger it gets (all its proportions remaining the
same) the more difficult it is for it to maintain itself aloft in flight.
The argument is as follows:</p>

<p>In order to keep aloft, the bird must communicate to the air
a downward momentum equivalent to its own weight, and therefore
proportional to <i>the cube of its own linear dimensions</i>. But
the momentum so communicated is proportional to the mass of
air driven downwards, and to the rate at which it is driven: the
mass being proportional to the bird’s wing-area, and also (with
any given slope of wing) to the speed of the bird, and the rate
being again proportional to the bird’s speed; accordingly the
whole momentum varies as the wing-area, i.e. as <i>the square of the
linear dimensions, and also as the square of the speed</i>. Therefore,
in order that the bird may maintain level flight, its speed must
be proportional to <i>the square root of its linear dimensions</i>.</p>

<p>Now the rate at which the bird, in steady flight, has to
work in order to drive itself forward, is the rate at which
it communicates energy to the air; and this is proportional
to <i>m&#xfeff;V</i>&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup>&#x202f;, i.e. to the mass and to the square of the
velocity of the air displaced. But the mass of air
displaced per second is proportional to the wing-area and
to the speed of the bird’s motion, and therefore to the
power 2½ of the linear dimensions; and the speed at
which it is displaced is proportional to the bird’s speed,
and therefore to the square root of the linear dimensions.
Therefore the energy communicated per second (being
proportional to the mass and to the square of the speed)
is jointly proportional to the power 2½ of the linear
dimensions, as above, and to the
first power thereof: <span class="xxpn" id="p025">{25}</span>
that is to say, it increases in proportion <i>to the power</i> 3½ <i>of the
linear dimensions</i>, and therefore faster than the weight of the
bird increases.</p>

<p>The work requiring to be done, then, varies as the power 3½ of
the bird’s linear dimensions, while the work of which the bird is
capable depends on the mass of its muscles, and therefore varies
as the cube of its linear dimensions<a class="afnanch" href="#fn39" id="fnanch39">39</a>.
The disproportion does not
seem at first sight very great, but it is quite enough to tell. It is
as much as to say that, every time we double the linear dimensions
of the bird, the difficulty of flight is increased in the ratio of
2&#xfeff;<sup>3</sup>&#x202f;:&#x202f;2&#xfeff;<sup>3½</sup>&#x202f;, or 8&#x202f;:&#x202f;11·3,
or, say, 1&#x202f;:&#x202f;1·4. If we take the ostrich to
exceed the sparrow in linear dimensions as 25&#x202f;:&#x202f;1, which seems well
within the mark, we have the ratio between 25&#xfeff;<sup>3½</sup> and 25&#xfeff;<sup>3</sup>&#x202f;, or
between 5&#xfeff;<sup>7</sup>&#x202f;:&#x202f;5&#xfeff;<sup>6</sup>&#x202f;; in other words, flight is just five times more
difficult for the larger than for the smaller bird<a class="afnanch" href="#fn40" id="fnanch40">40</a>.</p>

<p>The above in­ves­ti­ga­tion includes, besides the final result, a
number of others, explicit or implied, which are of not less importance.
Of these the simplest and also
the most important is <span class="xxpn" id="p026">{26}</span>
contained in the equation <i>V</i>
=&#x202f;√&#xfeff;<i>l</i>, a result which happens to be
identical with one we had also arrived at in the case of the fish.
In the bird’s case it has a deeper significance than in the other;
because it implies here not merely that the velocity will tend to
increase in a certain ratio with the length, but that it <i>must</i> do so
as an essential and primary condition of the bird’s remaining aloft.
It is accordingly of great practical importance in aeronautics, for
it shews how a provision of increasing speed must accompany every
enlargement of our aeroplanes. If a given machine weighing, say,
500 lbs. be stable at 40 miles an hour, then one geometrically
similar which weighs, say, a couple of tons must have its speed
determined as follows:</p>

<p class="pcontinue">That is to say, the larger machine must be capable of a speed
equal to 1·414&#x202f;×&#x202f;40, or about 56½ miles per hour.</p>

<p>It is highly probable, as Lanchester<a class="afnanch" href="#fn41" id="fnanch41">41</a>
remarks, that Lilienthal
met his untimely death not so much from any intrinsic fault in
the design or construction of his machine, but simply because his
engine fell somewhat short of the power required to give the
speed which was necessary for stability. An arrow is a very
imperfectly designed aeroplane, but nevertheless it is evidently
capable, to a certain extent and at a high velocity, of acquiring
“stability” and hence of actual “flight”: the duration and
consequent range of its trajectory, as compared with a bullet of
similar initial velocity, being correspondingly benefited. When
we return to our birds, and again compare the ostrich with the
sparrow, we know little or nothing about the speed in flight of
the latter, but that of the swift is estimated<a class="afnanch" href="#fn42" id="fnanch42">42</a>
to vary from a
minimum of 20 to 50 feet or more per second,—say from 14 to
35 miles per hour. Let us take the same lower limit as not far
from the minimal velocity of the sparrow’s
flight also; and it <span class="xxpn" id="p027">{27}</span>
would follow that the ostrich, of 25 times the sparrow’s linear
dimensions, would be compelled to fly (if it flew at all) with
a <i>minimum</i> velocity of 5&#x202f;×&#x202f;14, or 70 miles an hour.</p>

<p>The same principle of <i>necessary speed</i>, or the indispensable
relation between the dimensions of a flying object and the minimum
velocity at which it is stable, accounts for a great number of
observed phenomena. It tells us why the larger birds have a
marked difficulty in rising from the ground, that is to say, in
acquiring to begin with the horizontal velocity necessary for their
support; and why accordingly, as Mouillard<a class="afnanch" href="#fn43" id="fnanch43">43</a>
and others have
observed, the heavier birds, even those weighing no more than
a pound or two, can be effectively “caged” in a small enclosure
open to the sky. It tells us why very small birds, especially
those as small as humming-birds, and <i>à fortiori</i> the still smaller
insects, are capable of “stationary flight,” a very slight and
scarcely perceptible velocity <i>relatively to the air</i> being sufficient for
their support and stability. And again, since it is in all cases
velocity relative to the air that we are speaking of, we comprehend
the reason why one may always tell which way the wind blows
by watching the direction in which a bird <i>starts</i> to fly.</p>

<p>It is not improbable that the ostrich has already reached
a magnitude, and we may take it for certain that the moa did
so, at which flight by muscular action, according to the normal
anatomy of a bird, has become physiologically impossible. The
same reasoning applies to the case of man. It would be very
difficult, and probably absolutely impossible, for a bird to fly
were it the bigness of a man. But Borelli, in discussing this
question, laid even greater stress on the obvious fact that a man’s
pectoral muscles are so immensely less in proportion than those
of a bird, that however we may fit ourselves with wings we can
never expect to move them by any power of our own relatively
weaker muscles; so it is that artificial flight only became possible
when an engine was devised whose efficiency was extraordinarily
great in comparison with its weight and size.</p>

<p>Had Leonardo da Vinci known what Galileo knew, he would
not have spent a great part of his life on vain efforts to make to
himself wings. Borelli had learned the
lesson thoroughly, and <span class="xxpn" id="p028">{28}</span>
in one of his chapters he deals with the proposition, “Est impossible,
ut homines propriis viribus artificiose volare possint<a class="afnanch" href="#fn44" id="fnanch44">44</a>.”</p>

<p>But just as it is easier to swim than to fly, so is it obvious
that, in a denser atmosphere, the conditions of flight would be
altered, and flight facilitated. We know that in the carboniferous
epoch there lived giant dragon-flies, with wings of a span far
greater than nowadays they ever attain; and the small bodies
and huge extended wings of the fossil pterodactyles would seem
in like manner to be quite abnormal according to our present
standards, and to be beyond the limits of mechanical efficiency
under present conditions. But as Harlé suggests<a class="afnanch" href="#fn45" id="fnanch45">45</a>,
following
upon a suggestion of Arrhenius, we have only to suppose that in
carboniferous and jurassic days the terrestrial atmosphere was
notably denser than it is at present, by reason, for instance, of
its containing a much larger proportion of carbonic acid, and we
have at once a means of reconciling the apparent mechanical
discrepancy.</p>

<p>Very similar problems, involving in various ways the principle
of dynamical similitude, occur all through the physiology of
locomotion: as, for instance, when we see that a cockchafer can
carry a plate, many times his own weight, upon his back, or that
a flea can jump many inches high.</p>

<p>Problems of this latter class have been admirably treated both
by Galileo and by Borelli, but many later writers have remained
ignorant of their work. Linnaeus, for instance, remarked that,
if an elephant were as strong in proportion as a stag-beetle, it
would be able to pull up rocks by the root, and to level mountains.
And Kirby and Spence have a well-known passage directed to
shew that such powers as have been conferred upon the insect
have been withheld from the higher animals, for the reason that
had these latter been endued therewith they would have “caused
the early desolation of the world<a class="afnanch" href="#fn46" id="fnanch46">46</a>.”
<span class="xxpn" id="p029">{29}</span></p>

<p>Such problems as that which is presented by the flea’s jumping
powers, though essentially physiological in their nature, have their
interest for us here: because a steady, progressive diminution of
activity with increasing size would tend to set limits to the possible
growth in magnitude of an animal just as surely as those factors
which tend to break and crush the living fabric under its own
weight. In the case of a leap, we have to do rather with a sudden
impulse than with a continued strain, and this impulse should be
measured in terms of the velocity imparted. The velocity is
proportional to the impulse (<i>x</i>), and inversely proportional to the
mass (<i>M</i>) moved: <i>V</i>
=&#x202f;<i>x&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;M</i>. But, according to what we still speak
of as “Borelli’s law,” the impulse (i.e. the work of the impulse) is
proportional to the volume of the muscle by which it is
produced<a class="afnanch" href="#fn47" id="fnanch47">47</a>,
that is to say (in similarly constructed animals) to the mass of the
whole body; for the impulse is proportional on the one hand to
the cross-section of the muscle, and on the other to the distance
through which it contracts. It follows at once from this that the
velocity is constant, whatever be the size of the animals: in
other words, that all animals, provided always that they are
similarly fashioned, with their various levers etc., in like proportion,
ought to jump, not to the same relative, but to the same actual
height<a class="afnanch" href="#fn48" id="fnanch48">48</a>.
According to this, then, the flea is not a better, but
rather a worse jumper than a horse or a man. As a matter of
fact, Borelli is careful to point out that in the act of leaping the
impulse is not actually instantaneous, as in the blow of a hammer,
but takes some little time, during which the levers are being
extended by which the centre of gravity of the animal is being
propelled forwards; and this interval of time will be longer in
the case of the longer levers of the larger animal. To some extent,
then, this principle acts as a corrective to
the more general one, <span class="xxpn" id="p030">{30}</span>
and tends to leave a certain balance of advantage, in regard to
leaping power, on the side of the larger animal<a class="afnanch" href="#fn49" id="fnanch49">49</a>.</p>

<p>But on the other hand, the question of strength of materials
comes in once more, and the factors of stress and strain and
bending moment make it, so to speak, more and more difficult
for nature to endow the larger animal with the length of lever
with which she has provided the flea or the grasshopper.</p>

<p>To Kirby and Spence it seemed that “This wonderful strength
of insects is doubtless the result of something peculiar in the
structure and arrangement of their muscles, and principally their
extraordinary power of contraction.” This hypothesis, which is
so easily seen, on physical grounds, to be unnecessary, has been
amply disproved in a series of excellent papers by F. Plateau<a class="afnanch" href="#fn50" id="fnanch50">50</a>.</p>

<p>A somewhat simple problem is presented to us by the act of
walking. It is obvious that there will be a great economy of
work, if the leg swing at its normal <i>pendulum-rate</i>; and, though
this rate is hard to calculate, owing to the shape and the jointing
of the limb, we may easily convince ourselves, by counting our
steps, that the leg does actually swing, or tend to swing, just as
a pendulum does, at a certain definite rate<a class="afnanch" href="#fn51" id="fnanch51">51</a>.
When we walk
quicker, we cause the leg-pendulum to describe a greater arc, but
we do not appreciably cause it to swing, or vibrate, quicker, until
we shorten the pendulum and begin to run. Now let two individuals,
<i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, walk in a similar fashion, that is to say, with
a similar <i>angle</i> of swing. The <i>arc</i> through which the leg swings,
or the <i>amplitude</i> of each step, will therefore vary as the length
of leg, or say as <i>a&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;b</i>; but the time of swing
will vary as the square <span class="xxpn" id="p031">{31}</span>
root of the pendulum-length, or √&#xfeff;<i>a</i>&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;√&#xfeff;<i>b</i>.
Therefore the velocity,
which is measured by amplitude&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;time, will also vary as the square-roots
of the length of leg: that is to say, the average velocities of
<i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are in the ratio of √&#xfeff;<i>a</i>&#x202f;:&#x202f;√&#xfeff;<i>b</i>.</p>

<p>The smaller man, or smaller animal, is so far at a disadvantage
compared with the larger in speed, but only to the extent of the
ratio between the square roots of their linear dimensions: whereas,
if the rate of movement of the limb were identical, irrespective
of the size of the animal,—if the limbs of the mouse for instance
swung at the same rate as those of the horse,—then, as F. Plateau
said, the mouse would be as slow or slower in its gait than the
tortoise. M. Delisle<a class="afnanch" href="#fn52" id="fnanch52">52</a>
observed a “minute fly” walk three inches
in half-a-second. This was good steady walking. When we
walk five miles an hour we go about 88 inches in a second, or
88&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;6
=&#x202f;14·7 times the pace of M. Delisle’s fly. We should walk
at just about the fly’s pace if our stature were 1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;(14·7)&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup>&#x202f;, or 1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;216
of our present height,—say 72&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;216 inches, or one-third of an inch
high.</p>

<p>But the leg comprises a complicated system of levers, by whose
various exercise we shall obtain very different results. For
instance, by being careful to rise upon our instep, we considerably
increase the length or amplitude of our stride, and very considerably
increase our speed accordingly. On the other hand, in running,
we bend and so shorten the leg, in order to accommodate it to
a quicker rate of pendulum-swing<a class="afnanch" href="#fn53" id="fnanch53">53</a>.
In short, the jointed structure
of the leg permits us to use it as the shortest possible pendulum
when it is swinging, and as the longest possible lever when it is
exerting its propulsive force.</p>

<p>Apart from such modifications as that described in the last
paragraph,—apart, that is to say, from differences in mechanical
construction or in the manner in which the mechanism is used,—we
have now arrived at a curiously simple and uniform result.
For in all the three forms of locomotion
which we have attempted <span class="xxpn" id="p032">{32}</span>
to study, alike in swimming, in flight and in walking, the general
result, attained under very different conditions and arrived at by
very different modes of reasoning, is in every case that the velocity
tends to vary as the square root of the linear dimensions of the
organism.</p>

<p>From all the foregoing discussion we learn that, as Crookes
once upon a time remarked<a class="afnanch" href="#fn54" id="fnanch54">54</a>,
the form as well as the actions of our
bodies are entirely conditioned (save for certain exceptions in the
case of aquatic animals, nicely balanced with the density of the
surrounding medium) by the strength of gravity upon this globe.
Were the force of gravity to be doubled, our bipedal form would
be a failure, and the majority of terrestrial animals would resemble
short-legged saurians, or else serpents. Birds and insects would
also suffer, though there would be some compensation for them
in the increased density of the air. While on the other hand if
gravity were halved, we should get a lighter, more graceful, more
active type, requiring less energy and less heat, less heart, less
lungs, less blood.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole field of morphology we may find
examples of a tendency (referable doubtless in each case to some
definite physical cause) for surface to keep pace with volume,
through some alteration of its form. The development of “villi”
on the inner surface of the stomach and intestine (which enlarge
its surface much as we enlarge the effective surface of a bath-towel),
the various valvular folds of the intestinal lining, including
the remarkable “spiral fold” of the shark’s gut, the convolutions
of the brain, whose complexity is evidently correlated (in part
at least) with the magnitude of the animal,—all these and many
more are cases in which a more or less constant ratio tends to be
maintained between mass and surface, which ratio would have
been more and more departed from had it not been for the
alterations of surface-form<a class="afnanch" href="#fn55" id="fnanch55">55</a>.
<span class="xxpn" id="p033">{33}</span></p>

<p>In the case of very small animals, and of individual cells, the
principle becomes especially important, in consequence of the
molecular forces whose action is strictly limited to the superficial
layer. In the cases just mentioned, action is <i>facilitated</i> by increase
of surface: diffusion, for instance, of nutrient liquids or respiratory
gases is rendered more rapid by the greater area of surface; but
there are other cases in which the ratio of surface to mass may
make an essential change in the whole condition of the system.
We know, for instance, that iron rusts when exposed to moist
air, but that it rusts ever so much faster, and is soon eaten away,
if the iron be first reduced to a heap of small filings; this is a
mere difference of degree. But the spherical surface of the raindrop
and the spherical surface of the ocean (though both happen
to be alike in math­e­mat­i­cal form) are two totally different phenomena,
the one due to surface-energy, and the other to that form
of mass-energy which we ascribe to gravity. The contrast is still
more clearly seen in the case of waves: for the little ripple, whose
form and manner of propagation are governed by surface-tension,
is found to travel with a velocity which is inversely as the square
root of its length; while the ordinary big waves, controlled by
gravitation, have a velocity directly proportional to the square
root of their wave-length. In like manner we shall find that the
form of all small organisms is largely independent of gravity, and
largely if not mainly due to the force of surface-tension: either
as the direct result of the continued action of surface tension on
the semi-fluid body, or else as the result of its action at a prior
stage of development, in bringing about a form which subsequent
chemical changes have rendered rigid and lasting. In either case,
we shall find a very great tendency in small organisms to assume
either the spherical form or other simple forms related to ordinary
inanimate surface-tension phenomena; which forms do not recur
in the external morphology of large animals, or if they in part
recur it is for other reasons. <span class="xxpn" id="p034">{34}</span></p>

<p>Now this is a very important matter, and is a notable illustration
of that principle of similitude which we have already discussed
in regard to several of its manifestations. We are coming easily
to a conclusion which will affect the whole course of our argument
throughout this book, namely that there is an essential difference
in kind between the phenomena of form in the larger and the
smaller organisms. I have called this book a study of <i>Growth
and Form</i>, because in the most familiar illustrations of organic
form, as in our own bodies for example, these two factors are
inseparably associated, and because we are here justified in thinking
of form as the direct resultant and consequence of growth: of
growth, whose varying rate in one direction or another has produced,
by its gradual and unequal increments, the successive
stages of development and the final configuration of the whole
material structure. But it is by no means true that form and
growth are in this direct and simple fashion correlative or complementary
in the case of minute portions of living matter. For in
the smaller organisms, and in the individual cells of the larger,
we have reached an order of magnitude in which the intermolecular
forces strive under favourable conditions with, and at length
altogether outweigh, the force of gravity, and also those other
forces leading to movements of convection which are the prevailing
factors in the larger material aggregate.</p>

<p>However we shall require to deal more fully with this matter
in our discussion of the rate of growth, and we may leave it meanwhile,
in order to deal with other matters more or less directly
concerned with the magnitude of the cell.</p>

<p>The living cell is a very complex field of energy, and of energy
of many kinds, surface-energy included. Now the whole surface-energy
of the cell is by no means restricted to its <i>outer</i> surface;
for the cell is a very heterogeneous structure, and all its protoplasmic
alveoli and other visible (as well as invisible) heterogeneities
make up a great system of internal surfaces, at every
part of which one “phase” comes in contact with another “phase,”
and surface-energy is accordingly manifested. But still, the
external surface is a definite portion of the system, with a definite
“phase” of its own, and however little we may know of the distribution
of the total energy of the system, it is at
least plain that <span class="xxpn" id="p035">{35}</span>
the conditions which favour equi­lib­rium will be greatly altered by
the changed ratio of external surface to mass which a change of
magnitude, unaccompanied by change of form, produces in the cell.
In short, however it may be brought about, the phenomenon of
division of the cell will be precisely what is required to keep
ap­prox­i­mate­ly constant the ratio between surface and mass, and
to restore the balance between the surface-energy and the other
energies of the system. When a germ-cell, for instance, divides
or “segments” into two, it does not increase in mass; at least if
there be some slight alleged tendency for the egg to increase in
mass or volume during segmentation, it is very slight indeed,
generally imperceptible, and wholly denied by some<a class="afnanch" href="#fn56" id="fnanch56">56</a>.
The
development or growth of the egg from a one-celled stage to
stages of two or many cells, is thus a somewhat peculiar kind
of growth; it is growth which is limited to increase of surface,
unaccompanied by growth in volume or in mass.</p>

<p>In the case of a soap-bubble, by the way, if it divide into two
bubbles, the volume is actually diminished<a class="afnanch" href="#fn57" id="fnanch57">57</a>
while the surface-area
is greatly increased. This is due to a cause which we shall have
to study later, namely to the increased pressure due to the greater
curvature of the smaller bubbles.</p>

<p>An immediate and remarkable result of the principles just
described is a tendency on the part of all cells, according to their
kind, to vary but little about a certain mean size, and to have,
in fact, certain absolute limitations of magnitude.</p>

<p>Sachs<a class="afnanch" href="#fn58" id="fnanch58">58</a>
pointed out, in 1895, that there is a tendency for each
nucleus to be only able to gather around itself a certain definite
amount of protoplasm. Driesch<a class="afnanch" href="#fn59" id="fnanch59">59</a>,
a little later, found that, by
artificial subdivision of the egg, it was possible to rear dwarf
sea-urchin larvae, one-half, one-quarter, or
even one-eighth of their <span class="xxpn" id="p036">{36}</span>
normal size; and that these dwarf bodies were composed of only a
half, a quarter or an eighth of the normal number of cells. Similar
observations have been often repeated and amply confirmed. For
instance, in the development of <i>Crepidula</i> (a little American
“slipper-limpet,” now much at home on our own oyster-beds),
Conklin<a class="afnanch" href="#fn60" id="fnanch60">60</a>
has succeeded in rearing dwarf and giant individuals,
of which the latter may be as much as twenty-five times as big
as the former. But nevertheless, the individual cells, of skin, gut,
liver, muscle, and of all the other tissues, are just the same size
in one as in the other,—in dwarf and in giant<a class="afnanch" href="#fn61" id="fnanch61">61</a>.
Driesch has laid
particular stress upon this principle of a “fixed cell-size.”</p>

<p>We get an excellent, and more familiar illustration of the same
principle in comparing the large brain-cells or ganglion-cells, both
of the lower and of the higher animals<a class="afnanch" href="#fn62" id="fnanch62">62</a>.</p>

<div class="dctr01" id="fig1">

 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 1. Motor ganglion-cells, from
 the cervical spinal cord.<br /> (From Minot, after Irving
 Hardesty.)</div></div>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig1" title="go to Fig. 1">1</a> we have certain identical nerve-cells taken from
various mammals, from the mouse to the elephant, all represented
on the same scale of magnification; and we see at once that they
are all of much the same <i>order</i> of magnitude. The nerve-cell of
the elephant is about twice that of the mouse in linear dimensions,
and therefore about eight times greater in volume, or mass. But
making some allowance for difference of shape, the linear dimensions
of the elephant are to those of the mouse in a ratio certainly
not less than one to fifty; from which it would follow that the
bulk of the larger animal is something like 125,000 times that of
the less. And it also follows, the size of the
nerve-cells being <span class="xxpn" id="p037">{37}</span>
about as eight to one, that, in cor­re­spon­ding parts of the nervous
system of the two animals, there are more than 15,000 times as
many individual cells in one as in the other. In short we may
(with Enriques) lay it down as a general law that among animals,
whether large or small, the ganglion-cells vary in size within
narrow limits; and that, amidst all the great variety of structural
type of ganglion observed in different classes of animals, it is
always found that the smaller species have simpler ganglia than
the larger, that is to say ganglia containing a smaller number
of cellular elements<a class="afnanch" href="#fn63" id="fnanch63">63</a>.
The bearing of such simple facts as this
upon the cell-theory in general is not to be disregarded; and the
warning is especially clear against exaggerated attempts to
correlate physiological processes with the visible mechanism of
associated cells, rather than with the system of energies, or the
field of force, which is associated with them.
For the life of <span class="xxpn" id="p038">{38}</span>
the body is more than the <i>sum</i> of the properties of the cells of
which it is composed: as Goethe said, “Das Lebendige ist zwar
in Elemente zerlegt, aber man kann es aus diesen nicht wieder
zusammenstellen und beleben.”</p>

<p>Among certain lower and microscopic organisms, such for
instance as the Rotifera, we are still more palpably struck by the
small number of cells which go to constitute a usually complex
organ, such as kidney, stomach, ovary, etc. We can sometimes
number them in a few units, in place of the thousands that make
up such an organ in larger, if not always higher, animals. These
facts constitute one among many arguments which combine to
teach us that, however important and advantageous the subdivision
of organisms into cells may be from the constructional, or from
the dynamical point of view, the phenomenon has less essential
importance in theoretical biology than was once, and is often still,
assigned to it.</p>

<p>Again, just as Sachs shewed that there was a limit to the amount
of cytoplasm which could gather round a single nucleus, so Boveri
has demonstrated that the nucleus itself has definite limitations
of size, and that, in cell-division after fertilisation, each new
nucleus has the same size as its parent-nucleus<a class="afnanch" href="#fn64" id="fnanch64">64</a>.</p>

<p>In all these cases, then, there are reasons, partly no doubt
physiological, but in very large part purely physical, which set
limits to the normal magnitude of the organism or of the cell.
But as we have already discussed the existence of absolute and
definite limitations, of a physical kind, to the <i>possible</i> increase in
magnitude of an organism, let us now enquire whether there be
not also a lower limit, below which the very existence of an
organism is impossible, or at least where, under changed conditions,
its very nature must be profoundly modified.</p>

<p>Among the smallest of known organisms we have, for instance,
<i>Micromonas mesnili</i>, Bonel, a flagellate infusorian, which measures
about ·34 <i>µ</i>, or ·00034 mm., by ·00025 mm.; smaller even than
this we have a pathogenic micrococcus of the rabbit, <i>M. progrediens</i>,
Schröter, the diameter of which is said to be only ·00015
mm. or ·15 <i>µ</i>, or 1·5&#x202f;×&#x202f;10&#xfeff;<sup>−5</sup> cm.,—about
equal to the thickness of <span class="xxpn" id="p039">{39}</span>
the thinnest gold-leaf; and as small if not smaller still are a few
bacteria and their spores. But here we have reached, or all but
reached the utmost limits of ordinary microscopic vision; and
there remain still smaller organisms, the so-called “filter-passers,”
which the ultra-microscope reveals, but which are mainly brought
within our ken only by the maladies, such as hydrophobia, foot-and-mouth
disease, or the “mosaic” disease of the tobacco-plant,
to which these invisible micro-organisms give rise<a class="afnanch" href="#fn65" id="fnanch65">65</a>.
Accordingly,
since it is only by the diseases which they occasion that these
tiny bodies are made known to us, we might be tempted to
suppose that innumerable other invisible organisms, smaller and
yet smaller, exist unseen and unrecognised by man.</p>

<p>A bacillus of ordinary, typical size is, say, 1 µ in length. The
length (or height) of a man is about a million and three-quarter
times as great, i.e. 1·75 metres, or 1·75&#x202f;×&#x202f;10&#xfeff;<sup>6</sup> µ; and the mass of
the man is in the neighbourhood of five million, million, million
(5&#x202f;×&#x202f;10&#xfeff;<sup>18</sup>) times greater than that of the bacillus. If we ask
whether there may not exist organisms as much less than the
bacillus as the bacillus is less than the dimensions of a man, it
is very easy to see that this is quite impossible, for we are rapidly
approaching a point where the question of molecular dimensions,
and of the ultimate divisibility of matter, begins to call for our
attention, and to obtrude itself as a crucial factor in the case.</p>

<div class="dmaths">
<p>Clerk Maxwell dealt with this matter in his article “Atom<a class="afnanch" href="#fn67" id="fnanch67">67</a>,”
and, in somewhat greater detail, Errera discusses the question on
the following lines<a class="afnanch" href="#fn68" id="fnanch68">68</a>.
The weight of a hydrogen molecule is,
according to the physical chemists, somewhere about 8·6&#x202f;×&#x202f;2&#x202f;×&#x202f;10&#xfeff;<sup>−22</sup>

only contain 10 sulphur-atoms, and therefore only ten chemical
“molecules” or units of protoplasm!</p>

<div class="dmaths">
<p>It may be open to doubt whether the presence of sulphur
be really essential to the constitution of the proteid or
“protoplasmic” molecule; but Errera gives us yet another
illustration of a similar kind, which is free from this
objection or dubiety. The molecule of albumin, as is
generally agreed, can scarcely be less than a thousand
times the size of that of such an element as sulphur:
according to one particular determination<a class="afnanch"
href="#fn70" id="fnanch70">70</a>, serum albumin has
a constitution cor­re­spon­ding to a molecular weight
of 10,166, and even this may be far short of the true
complexity of a typical albuminoid molecule. The weight of
such a molecule is</p>

<div>8·6&#x202f;×&#x202f;10166&#x202f;×&#x202f;10&#xfeff;<sup>−22</sup>

<p class="pcontinue">Now the bacteria contain about 14% of albuminoids, these
constituting by far the greater part of the dry residue; and

is about</p>

<p class="pcontinue">in other words, our micrococcus apparently contains something
less than 30,000 molecules of albumin. <span class="xxpn" id="p042">{42}</span></p>
</div><!--dmaths-->

<p>According to the most recent estimates, the weight of the
hydrogen molecule is somewhat less than that on which Errera
based his calculations, namely about 16&#x202f;×&#x202f;10&#xfeff;<sup>−22</sup> mgms. and
according to this value, our micrococcus would contain just about
27,000 albumin molecules. In other words, whichever determination
we accept, we see that an organism one-tenth as large as our
micrococcus, in linear dimensions, would only contain some thirty
molecules of albumin; or, in other words, our micrococcus is only
about thirty times as large, in linear dimensions, as a single albumin
molecule<a class="afnanch" href="#fn71" id="fnanch71">71</a>.</p>

<p>We must doubtless make large allowances for uncertainty in
the assumptions and estimates upon which these calculations are
based; and we must also remember that the data with which the
physicist provides us in regard to molecular magnitudes are, to
a very great extent, <i>maximal</i> values, above which the molecular
magnitude (or rather the sphere of the molecule’s range of motion)
is not likely to lie: but below which there is a greater element of
uncertainty as to its possibly greater minuteness. But nevertheless,
when we shall have made all reasonable allowances for uncertainty
upon the physical side, it will still be clear that the smallest known
bodies which are described as organisms draw nigh towards
molecular magnitudes, and we must recognise that the subdivision
of the organism cannot proceed to an indefinite extent, and in all
probability cannot go very much further than it appears to have
done in these already discovered forms. For, even, after giving
all due regard to the complexity of our unit (that is to say the
albumin-molecule), with all the increased possibilities of interrelation
with its neighbours which this complexity implies, we
cannot but see that physiologically, and comparatively speaking,
we have come down to a very simple thing.</p>

<p>While such con­si­de­ra­tions as these, based on the chemical
composition of the organism, teach us that there must be a definite
lower limit to its magnitude, other con­si­de­ra­tions of a purely
physical kind lead us to the same conclusion. For our discussion
of the principle of similitude has already taught us that, long
before we reach these almost infinitesimal
magnitudes, the <span class="xxpn" id="p043">{43}</span>
diminishing organism will have greatly changed in all its physical
relations, and must at length arrive under conditions which must
surely be incompatible with anything such as we understand by
life, at least in its full and ordinary development and manifestation.</p>

<p>We are told, for instance, that the powerful force of surface-tension,
or capillarity, begins to act within a range of about
1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;500,000 of an inch, or say 0·05 µ. A soap-film, or a film of oil
upon water, may be attenuated to far less magnitudes than this;
the black spots upon a soap-bubble are known, by various concordant
methods of measurement, to be only about 6&#x202f;×&#x202f;10&#xfeff;<sup>−7</sup> cm.,
or about ·006 µ thick, and Lord Rayleigh and M. Devaux<a class="afnanch" href="#fn72" id="fnanch72">72</a>
have
obtained films of oil of ·002 µ, or even ·001 µ in thickness.</p>

<p>But while it is possible for a fluid film to exist in these almost
molecular dimensions, it is certain that, long before we reach
them, there must arise new conditions of which we have little
knowledge and which it is not easy even to imagine.</p>

<p>It would seem that, in an organism of ·1 µ in diameter, or even
rather more, there can be no essential distinction between the
interior and the surface layers. No hollow vesicle, I take it, can
exist of these dimensions, or at least, if it be possible for it to do
so, the contained gas or fluid must be under pressures of a formidable
kind<a class="afnanch" href="#fn73" id="fnanch73">73</a>,
and of which we have no knowledge or experience.
Nor, I imagine, can there be any real complexity, or heterogeneity,
of its fluid or semi-fluid contents; there can be no vacuoles within
such a cell, nor any layers defined within its fluid substance, for
something of the nature of a boundary-film is the necessary
condition of the existence of such layers. Moreover, the whole
organism, provided that it be fluid or semi-fluid, can only be
spherical in form. What, then, can we attribute, in the way of
properties, to an organism of a size as small as, or smaller than,
say ·05 µ? It must, in all probability, be a homogeneous, structureless
sphere, composed of a very small number of albuminoid or
other molecules. Its vital properties and functions must be
extraordinarily limited; its specific outward characters, even if we
could see it, must be <i>nil</i>; and its specific properties must be little
more than those of an ion-laden corpuscle,
enabling it to perform <span class="xxpn" id="p044">{44}</span>
this or that chemical reaction, or to produce this or that pathogenic
effect. Even among inorganic, non-living bodies, there
must be a certain grade of minuteness at which the ordinary
properties become modified. For instance, while under ordinary
circumstances cry­stal­li­sa­tion starts in a solution about a minute
solid fragment or crystal of the salt, Ostwald has shewn that we
may have particles so minute that they fail to serve as a nucleus
for cry­stal­li­sa­tion,—which is as much as to say that they are too
minute to have the form and properties of a “crystal”; and again,
in his thin oil-films, Lord Rayleigh has noted the striking change
of physical properties which ensues when the film becomes
attenuated to something less than one close-packed layer of
molecules<a class="afnanch" href="#fn74" id="fnanch74">74</a>.</p>

<p>Thus, as Clerk Maxwell put it, “molecular science sets us face
to face with physiological theories. It forbids the physiologist
from imagining that structural details of infinitely small dimensions
[such as Leibniz assumed, one within another, <i>ad infinitum</i>]
can furnish an explanation of the infinite variety which exists in
the properties and functions of the most minute organisms.”
And for this reason he reprobates, with not undue severity, those
advocates of pangenesis and similar theories of heredity, who
would place “a whole world of wonders within a body so small
and so devoid of visible structure as a germ.” But indeed it
scarcely needed Maxwell’s criticism to shew forth the immense
physical difficulties of Darwin’s theory of Pangenesis: which,
after all, is as old as Democritus, and is no other than that
Promethean <i>particulam undique desectam</i> of which we have read,
and at which we have smiled, in our Horace.</p>

<p>There are many other ways in which, when we “make a long
excursion into space,” we find our ordinary rules of physical
behaviour entirely upset. A very familiar case, analysed by
Stokes, is that the viscosity of the surrounding medium has a
relatively powerful effect upon bodies below a certain size.
A droplet of water, a thousandth of an inch (25 µ) in diameter,
cannot fall in still air quicker than about an inch and a half per
second; and as its size decreases, its resistance varies as the
diameter, and not (as with larger bodies) as
the surface of the <span class="xxpn" id="p045">{45}</span>
drop. Thus a drop one-tenth of that size (2·5 µ), the size,
apparently, of the drops of water in a light cloud, will fall a
hundred times slower, or say an inch a minute; and one again
a tenth of this diameter (say ·25 µ, or about twice as big, in linear
dimensions, as our micrococcus), will scarcely fall an inch in two
hours. By reason of this principle, not only do the smaller
bacteria fall very slowly through the air, but all minute bodies
meet with great proportionate resistance to their movements in
a fluid. Even such comparatively large organisms as the diatoms
and the foraminifera, laden though they are with a heavy shell
of flint or lime, seem to be poised in the water of the ocean, and
fall in it with exceeding slowness.</p>

<p>The Brownian movement has also to be reckoned with,—that
remarkable phenomenon studied nearly a century ago (1827) by
Robert Brown, <i>facile princeps botanicorum</i>. It is one more of those
fundamental physical phenomena which the biologists have contributed,
or helped to contribute, to the science of physics.</p>

<p>The quivering motion, accompanied by rotation, and even by
translation, manifested by the fine granular particles issuing from
a crushed pollen-grain, and which Robert Brown proved to have
no vital significance but to be manifested also by all minute
particles whatsoever, organic and inorganic, was for many years
unexplained. Nearly fifty years after Brown wrote, it was said
to be “due, either directly to some calorical changes continually
taking place in the fluid, or to some obscure chemical action
between the solid particles and the fluid which is indirectly
promoted by heat<a class="afnanch" href="#fn75" id="fnanch75">75</a>.”
Very shortly after these last words were
written, it was ascribed by Wiener to molecular action, and we
now know that it is indeed due to the impact or bombardment of
molecules upon a body so small that these impacts do not for
the moment, as it were, “average out” to ap­prox­i­mate equality
on all sides. The movement becomes manifest with particles of
somewhere about 20 µ in diameter, it is admirably displayed by
particles of about 12 µ in diameter, and becomes more marked
the smaller the particles are. The bombardment causes our
particles to behave just like molecules of
uncommon size, and this <span class="xxpn" id="p046">{46}</span>
behaviour is manifested in several ways<a class="afnanch" href="#fn76" id="fnanch76">76</a>.
Firstly, we have the
quivering movement of the particles; secondly, their movement
backwards and forwards, in short, straight, disjointed paths;
thirdly, the particles rotate, and do so the more rapidly the smaller
they are, and by theory, confirmed by observation, it is found
that particles of 1 µ in diameter rotate on an average through
100° per second, while particles of 13 µ in diameter turn through
only 14° per minute. Lastly, the very curious result appears, that
in a layer of fluid the particles are not equally distributed, nor do
they all ever fall, under the influence of gravity, to the bottom.
But just as the molecules of the atmosphere are so distributed,
under the influence of gravity, that the density (and therefore the
number of molecules per unit volume) falls off in geometrical
progression as we ascend to higher and higher layers, so is it with
our particles, even within the narrow limits of the little portion
of fluid under our microscope. It is only in regard to particles
of the simplest form that these phenomena have been theoretically
investigated<a class="afnanch" href="#fn77" id="fnanch77">77</a>,
and we may take it as certain that more complex
particles, such as the twisted body of a Spirillum, would show
other and still more complicated manifestations. It is at least
clear that, just as the early microscopists in the days before Robert
Brown never doubted but that these phenomena were purely
vital, so we also may still be apt to confuse, in certain cases, the
one phenomenon with the other. We cannot, indeed, without the
most careful scrutiny, decide whether the movements of our
minutest organisms are intrinsically “vital” (in the sense of being
beyond a physical mechanism, or working model) or not. For example,
Schaudinn has suggested that the undulating movements of
<i>Spirochaete pallida</i> must be due to the presence of a minute, unseen,
“undulating membrane”; and Doflein says of the same species
that “sie verharrt oft mit eigenthümlich zitternden Bewegungen
zu einem Orte.” Both movements, the
trembling or quivering <span class="xxpn" id="p047">{47}</span>
movement described by Doflein, and the undulating or rotating
movement described by Schaudinn, are just such as may be easily
and naturally interpreted as part and parcel of the Brownian
phenomenon.</p>

<p>While the Brownian movement may thus simulate in a deceptive
way the active movements of an organism, the reverse statement
also to a certain extent holds good. One sometimes lies awake of
a summer’s morning watching the flies as they dance under the
ceiling. It is a very remarkable dance. The dancers do not
whirl or gyrate, either in company or alone; but they advance
and retire; they seem to jostle and rebound; between the rebounds
they dart hither or thither in short straight snatches of hurried
flight; and turn again sharply in a new rebound at the end of each
little rush. Their motions are wholly “erratic,” independent of
one another, and devoid of common purpose. This is nothing else
than a vastly magnified picture, or simulacrum, of the Brownian
movement; the parallel between the two cases lies in their
complete irregularity, but this in itself implies a close resemblance.
One might see the same thing in a crowded market-place, always
provided that the bustling crowd had no <i>business</i> whatsoever.
In like manner Lucretius, and Epicurus before him, watched the
dust-motes quivering in the beam, and saw in them a mimic
representation, <i>rei simulacrum et imago</i>, of the eternal motions of
the atoms. Again the same phenomenon may be witnessed under
the microscope, in a drop of water swarming with Paramoecia or
suchlike Infusoria; and here the analogy has been put to a numerical
test. Following with a pencil the track of each little swimmer,
and dotting its place every few seconds (to the beat of a metronome),
Karl Przibram found that the mean successive distances from a
common base-line obeyed with great exactitude the “Einstein
formula,” that is to say the particular form of the “law of chance”
which is applicable to the case of the Brownian movement<a class="afnanch" href="#fn78" id="fnanch78">78</a>.
The
phenomenon is (of course) merely analogous, and by no means
identical with the Brownian movement; for the range of motion
of the little active organisms, whether they be gnats or infusoria,
is vastly greater than that of the minute
particles which are <span class="xxpn" id="p048">{48}</span>
passive under bombardment; but nevertheless Przibram is
inclined to think that even his comparatively large infusoria are
small enough for the molecular bombardment to be a stimulus,
though not the actual cause, of their irregular and interrupted
movements.</p>

<p>There is yet another very remarkable phenomenon which may
come into play in the case of the minutest of organisms; and this
is their relation to the rays of light, as Arrhenius has told us.
On the waves of a beam of light, a very minute particle (<i>in
vacuo</i>) should be actually caught up, and carried along with
an immense velocity; and this “radiant pressure” exercises
its most powerful influence on bodies which (if they be of
spherical form) are just about ·00016 mm., or ·16 µ in diameter.
This is just about the size, as we have seen, of some of
our smallest known protozoa and bacteria, while we have
some reason to believe that others yet unseen, and perhaps
the spores of many, are smaller still. Now we have seen that
such minute particles fall with extreme slowness in air, even at
ordinary atmospheric pressures: our organism measuring ·16 µ
would fall but 83 metres in a year, which is as much as to say
that its weight offers practically no impediment to its transference,
by the slightest current, to the very highest regions of the atmosphere.
Beyond the atmosphere, however, it cannot go, until
some new force enable it to resist the attraction of terrestrial
gravity, which the viscosity of an atmosphere is no longer at
hand to oppose. But it is conceivable that our particle <i>may</i> go
yet farther, and actually break loose from the bonds of earth.
For in the upper regions of the atmosphere, say fifty miles high,
it will come in contact with the rays and flashes of the Northern
Lights, which consist (as Arrhenius maintains) of a fine dust, or
cloud of vapour-drops, laden with a charge of negative electricity,
and projected outwards from the sun. As soon as our particle
acquires a charge of negative electricity it will begin to be repelled
by the similarly laden auroral particles, and the amount of charge
necessary to enable a particle of given size (such as our little
monad of ·16 µ) to resist the attraction of gravity may be calculated,
and is found to be such as the actual conditions can easily supply.
Finally, when once set free from the entanglement
of the earth’s <span class="xxpn" id="p049">{49}</span>
atmosphere, the particle may be propelled by the “radiant
pressure” of light, with a velocity which will carry it.—like
Uriel gliding on a sunbeam,—as far as the orbit of Mars in
twenty days, of Jupiter in eighty days, and as far as the nearest
fixed star in three thousand years! This, and much more, is
Arrhenius’s contribution towards the acceptance of Lord Kelvin’s
hypothesis that life may be, and may have been, disseminated
across the bounds of space, throughout the solar system and the
whole universe!</p>

<p>It may well be that we need attach no great practical importance
to this bold conception; for even though stellar space be shewn to
be <i>mare liberum</i> to minute material travellers, we may be sure that
those which reach a stellar or even a planetary bourne are infinitely,
or all but infinitely, few. But whether or no, the remote possibilities
of the case serve to illustrate in a very vivid way the profound
differences of physical property and potentiality which are
associated in the scale of magnitude with simple differences of
degree.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="p050">
<h2 class="h2herein" title="III. The Rate of Growth.">CHAPTER III
<span class="h2ttl">
THE RATE OF GROWTH</span></h2></div>

<p>When we study magnitude by itself, apart, that is to say,
from the gradual changes to which it may be subject, we are
dealing with a something which may be adequately represented
by a number, or by means of a line of definite length; it is what
mathematicians call a <i>scalar</i> phenomenon. When we introduce
the conception of change of magnitude, of magnitude which varies
as we pass from one direction to another in space, or from one
instant to another in time, our phenomenon becomes capable of
representation by means of a line of which we define both the
length and the direction; it is (in this particular aspect) what is
called a <i>vector</i> phenomenon.</p>

<p>When we deal with magnitude in relation to the dimensions
of space, the vector diagram which we draw plots magnitude in
one direction against magnitude in another,—length against
height, for instance, or against breadth; and the result is simply
what we call a picture or drawing of an object, or (more correctly)
a “plane projection” of the object. In other words, what we
call Form is a <i>ratio of magnitudes</i>, referred to direction in space.</p>

<p>When in dealing with magnitude we refer its variations to
successive intervals of time (or when, as it is said, we <i>equate</i> it
with time), we are then dealing with the phenomenon of <i>growth</i>;
and it is evident, therefore, that this term growth has wide
meanings. For growth may obviously be positive or negative;
that is to say, a thing may grow larger or smaller, greater or less;
and by extension of the primitive concrete signification of the
word, we easily and legitimately apply it to non-material things,
such as temperature, and say, for instance, that a body “grows”
hot or cold. When in a two-dimensional diagram, we represent
a magnitude (for instance length) in relation to
time (or “plot” <span class="xxpn" id="p051">{51}</span>
length against time, as the phrase is), we get that kind of vector
diagram which is commonly known as a “curve of growth.” We
perceive, accordingly, that the phenomenon which we are now
studying is a <i>velocity</i> (whose “dimensions” are
&#xfeff;<sup>Space</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>Time</sub> or
&#xfeff;<sup class="spitc">L</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub class="spitc">T</sub>); and
this phenomenon we shall speak of, simply, as a rate of growth.</p>

<p>In various conventional ways we can convert a two-dimensional
into a three-dimensional diagram. We do so, for example, by
means of the geometrical method of “perspective” when we
represent upon a sheet of paper the length, breadth and depth of
an object in three-dimensional space; but we do it more simply,
as a rule, by means of “contour-lines,” and always when time is
one of the dimensions to be represented. If we superimpose upon
one another (or even set side by side) pictures, or plane projections,
of an organism, drawn at successive intervals of time, we have
such a three-dimensional diagram, which is a partial representation
(limited to two dimensions of <i>space</i>) of the organism’s gradual
change of form, or course of development; and in such a case
our contour-lines may, for the purposes of the embryologist, be
separated by intervals representing a few hours or days, or, for
the purposes of the palaeontologist, by interspaces of unnumbered
and innumerable years<a class="afnanch" href="#fn79" id="fnanch79">79</a>.</p>

<p>Such a diagram represents in two of its three dimensions form,
and in two, or three, of its dimensions growth; and so we see how
intimately the two conceptions are correlated or inter-related to
one another. In short, it is obvious that the form of an animal
is determined by its specific rate of growth in various directions;
accordingly, the phenomenon of rate of growth deserves to be
studied as a necessary preliminary to the theoretical study of
form, and, math­e­mat­i­cally speaking, organic form itself appears
to us as a <i>function of time</i><a class="afnanch" href="#fn80" id="fnanch80">80</a>.
<span class="xxpn" id="p052">{52}</span></p>

<p>At the same time, we need only consider this part of our
subject somewhat briefly. Though it has an essential bearing on
the problems of morphology, it is in greater degree involved with
physiological problems; and furthermore, the statistical or
numerical aspect of the question is peculiarly adapted for the
math­e­mat­i­cal study of variation and correlation. On these
important subjects we shall scarcely touch; for our main purpose
will be sufficiently served if we consider the char­ac­teris­tics of a
rate of growth in a few illustrative cases, and recognise that this
rate of growth is a very important specific property, with its own
char­ac­ter­is­tic value in this organism or that, in this or that part
of each organism, and in this or that phase of its existence.</p>

<p>The statement which we have just made that “the form of an
organism is determined by its rate of growth in various directions,”
is one which calls (as we have partly seen in the foregoing chapter)
for further explanation and for some measure of qualification.
Among organic forms we shall have frequent occasion to see that
form is in many cases due to the immediate or direct action of
certain molecular forces, of which surface-tension is that which plays
the greatest part. Now when surface-tension (for instance) causes
a minute semi-fluid organism to assume a spherical form, or gives
the form of a catenary or an elastic curve to a film of protoplasm
in contact with some solid skeletal rod, or when it acts in various
other ways which are productive of definite contours, this is a process
of conformation that, both in appearance and reality, is very
different from the process by which an ordinary plant or animal
<i>grows</i> into its specific form. In both cases, change of form is
brought about by the movement of portions of matter, and in
both cases it is <i>ultimately</i> due to the action of molecular forces;
but in the one case the movements of the particles of matter lie
for the most part <i>within molecular range</i>, while in the other we
have to deal chiefly with the transference of portions of matter
into the system from without, and from one widely distant part
of the organism to another. It is to this latter class of phenomena
that we usually restrict the term growth; and it is in regard to
them that we are in a position to study the <i>rate of action</i> in
different directions, and to see that it is merely on a difference
of velocities that the modification of
form essentially depends. <span class="xxpn" id="p053">{53}</span>
The difference between the two classes of phenomena is somewhat
akin to the difference between the forces which determine the
form of a rain-drop and those which, by the flowing of the waters
and the sculpturing of the solid earth, have brought about the
complex configuration of a river; <i>molecular</i> forces are paramount
in the conformation of the one, and <i>molar</i> forces are dominant
in the other.</p>

<p>At the same time it is perfectly true that <i>all</i> changes of form,
inasmuch as they necessarily involve changes of actual and relative
magnitude, may, in a sense, be properly looked upon as phenomena
of growth; and it is also true, since the movement of matter must
always involve an element of time<a class="afnanch" href="#fn81" id="fnanch81">81</a>,
that in all cases the rate of
growth is a phenomenon to be considered. Even though the
molecular forces which play their part in modifying the form of
an organism exert an action which is, theoretically, all but
instantaneous, that action is apt to be dragged out to an appreciable
interval of time by reason of viscosity or some other form of
resistance in the material. From the physical or physiological
point of view the rate of action even in such cases may be well
worth studying; for example, a study of the rate of cell-division
in a segmenting egg may teach us something about the work done,
and about the various energies concerned. But in such cases the
action is, as a rule, so homogeneous, and the form finally attained
is so definite and so little dependent on the time taken to effect
it, that the specific rate of change, or rate of growth, does not
enter into the <i>morphological</i> problem.</p>

<p>To sum up, we may lay down the following general statements.
The form of organisms is a phenomenon to be referred in part
to the direct action of molecular forces, in part to a more complex
and slower process, indirectly resulting from chemical, osmotic
and other forces, by which material is introduced into the organism
and transferred from one part of it to another. It is this latter
complex phenomenon which we usually
speak of as “growth.” <span class="xxpn" id="p054">{54}</span></p>

<p>Every growing organism, and every part of such a growing
organism, has its own specific rate of growth, referred to a particular
direction. It is the ratio between the rates of growth in various
directions by which we must account for the external forms of
all, save certain very minute, organisms. This ratio between
rates of growth in various directions may sometimes be of a
<i>simple</i> kind, as when it results in the math­e­mat­i­cally definable
outline of a shell, or in the smooth curve of the margin of a leaf.
It may sometimes be a very <i>constant</i> one, in which case the
organism, while growing in bulk, suffers little or no perceptible
change in form; but such equi­lib­rium seldom endures for more
than a season, and when the <i>ratio</i> tends to alter, then we have
the phenomenon of morphological “development,” or steady and
persistent change of form.</p>

<p>This elementary concept of Form, as determined by varying
rates of Growth, was clearly apprehended by the math­e­mat­i­cal
mind of Haller,—who had learned his mathematics of the great
John Bernoulli, as the latter in turn had learned his physiology
from the writings of Borelli. Indeed it was this very point, the
apparently unlimited extent to which, in the development of the
chick, inequalities of growth could and did produce changes of
form and changes of anatomical “structure,” that led Haller to
surmise that the process was actually without limits, and that all
development was but an unfolding, or “<i>evolutio</i>,” in which no
part came into being which had not essentially existed before<a class="afnanch" href="#fn82" id="fnanch82">82</a>.
In short the celebrated doctrine of “preformation” implied on the
one hand a clear recognition of what, throughout the later stages
of development, growth can do, by hastening the increase in size
of one part, hindering that of another, changing their relative
magnitudes and positions, and altering their forms; while on the
other hand it betrayed a failure (inevitable in those days) to
recognise the essential difference between these movements of
masses and the molecular processes which
precede and accompany <span class="xxpn" id="p055">{55}</span>
them, and which are char­ac­ter­is­tic of another order of magnitude.</p>

<p>By other writers besides Haller the very general, though not
strictly universal connection between form and rate of growth
has been clearly recognised. Such a connection is implicit in
those “proportional diagrams” by which Dürer and some of his
brother artists were wont to illustrate the successive changes of
form, or of relative dimensions, which attend the growth of the
child, to boyhood and to manhood. The same connection was
recognised, more explicitly, by some of the older embryologists,
for instance by Pander<a class="afnanch" href="#fn83" id="fnanch83">83</a>,
and appears, as a survival of the
doctrine of preformation, in his study of the development of
the chick. And long afterwards, the embryological aspect of
the case was emphasised by His, who pointed out, for instance,
that the various foldings of the blastoderm, by which the neural
and amniotic folds were brought into being, were essentially
and obviously the resultant of unequal rates of growth,—of
local accelerations or retardations of growth,—in what to begin
with was an even and uniform layer of embryonic tissue. If
we imagine a flat sheet of paper, parts of which are caused
(as by moisture or evaporation) to expand or to contract, the
plane surface is at once dimpled, or “buckled,” or folded, by
the resultant forces of expansion or contraction: and the various
distortions to which the plane surface of the “germinal disc” is
subject, as His shewed once and for all, are precisely analogous.
An experimental demonstration still more closely comparable to
the actual case of the blastoderm, is obtained by making an
“artificial blastoderm,” of little pills or pellets of dough, which
are caused to grow, with varying velocities, by the addition
of varying quantities of yeast. Here, as Roux is careful to
point out<a class="afnanch" href="#fn84" id="fnanch84">84</a>,
we observe that it is not only the <i>growth</i> of the
individual cells, but the <i>traction</i> exercised through their mutual
interconnections, which brings about the foldings and other distortions
of the entire structure. <span class="xxpn" id="p056">{56}</span></p>

<p>But this again was clearly present to Haller’s mind, and formed
an essential part of his embryological doctrine. For he has no
sooner treated of <i>incrementum</i>, or <i>celeritas incrementi</i>, than he
proceeds to deal with the contributory and complementary phenomena
of expansion, traction (<i>adtractio</i>)<a class="afnanch" href="#fn85" id="fnanch85">85</a>,
and pressure, and the
more subtle influences which he denominates <i>vis derivationis et
revulsionis</i><a class="afnanch" href="#fn86" id="fnanch86">86</a>:
these latter being the secondary and correlated
effects on growth in one part, brought about, through such
changes as are produced (for instance) in the circulation, by the
growth of another.</p>

<p>Let us admit that, on the physiological side, Haller’s or His’s
methods of explanation carry us back but a little way; yet even
this little way is something gained. Nevertheless, I can well
remember the harsh criticism, and even contempt, which His’s
doctrine met with, not merely on the ground that it was inadequate,
but because such an explanation was deemed wholly inappropriate,
and was utterly disavowed<a class="afnanch" href="#fn87" id="fnanch87">87</a>.
Hertwig, for instance, asserted that,
in embryology, when we found one embryonic stage preceding
another, the existence of the former was, for the embryologist,
an all-sufficient “causal explanation” of the latter. “We consider
(he says), that we are studying and explaining a causal relation
when we have demonstrated that the gastrula arises by invagination
of a blastosphere, or the neural canal by the infolding of a
cell plate so as to constitute a tube<a class="afnanch" href="#fn88" id="fnanch88">88</a>.”
For Hertwig, therefore, as <span class="xxpn" id="p057">{57}</span>
Roux remarks, the task of investigating a physical mechanism in
embryology,—“der Ziel das Wirken zu erforschen,”—has no
existence at all. For Balfour also, as for Hertwig, the mechanical
or physical aspect of organic development had little or no attraction.
In one notable instance, Balfour himself adduced a physical, or
quasi-physical, explanation of an organic process, when he referred
the various modes of segmentation of an ovum, complete or partial,
equal or unequal and so forth, to the varying amount or the
varying distribution of food yolk in association with the germinal
protoplasm of the egg<a class="afnanch" href="#fn89" id="fnanch89">89</a>.
But in the main, Balfour, like all the
other embryologists of his day, was engrossed by the problems of
phylogeny, and he expressly defined the aims of comparative
embryology (as exemplified in his own textbook) as being “twofold:
(1) to form a basis for Phylogeny. and (2) to form a basis
for Organogeny or the origin and evolution of organs<a class="afnanch" href="#fn90" id="fnanch90">90</a>.”</p>

<p>It has been the great service of Roux and his fellow-workers
of the school of “Ent­wicke­lungs­me­cha­nik,” and of many other
students to whose work we shall refer, to try, as His tried<a class="afnanch" href="#fn91" id="fnanch91">91</a>
to
import into embryology, wherever possible, the simpler concepts
of physics, to introduce along with them the method of experiment,
and to refuse to be bound by the narrow limitations which such
teaching as that of Hertwig would of necessity impose on the
work and the thought and on the whole philosophy of the biologist.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Before we pass from this general discussion to study some of
the particular phenomena of growth, let me give a single illustration,
from Darwin, of a point of view which is in marked contrast to
Haller’s simple but essentially math­e­mat­i­cal conception of Form.</p>

<p>There is a curious passage in the <i>Origin of Species</i><a class="afnanch" href="#fn92" id="fnanch92">92</a>,
where
Darwin is discussing the leading facts of embryology, and in
particular Von Baer’s “law of embryonic resemblance.” Here
Darwin says “We are so much accustomed to
see a difference in <span class="xxpn" id="p058">{58}</span>
structure between the embryo and the adult, that we are tempted
to look at this difference as in some necessary manner contingent
on growth. <i>But there is no reason why, for instance, the wing of
a bat, or the fin of a porpoise, should not have been sketched out with
all their parts in proper proportion, as soon as any part became
visible.</i>” After pointing out with his habitual care various
exceptions, Darwin proceeds to lay down two general principles,
viz. “that slight variations generally appear at a not very early
period of life,” and secondly, that “at whatever age a variation
first appears in the parent, it tends to reappear at a cor­re­spon­ding
age in the offspring.” He then argues that it is with nature as
with the fancier, who does not care what his pigeons look like
in the embryo, so long as the full-grown bird possesses the desired
qualities; and that the process of selection takes place when
the birds or other animals are nearly grown up,—at least on the
part of the breeder, and presumably in nature as a general rule.
The illustration of these principles is set forth as follows; “Let
us take a group of birds, descended from some ancient form and
modified through natural selection for different habits. Then,
from the many successive variations having supervened in the
several species at a not very early age, and having been inherited
at a cor­re­spon­ding age, the young will still resemble each other
much more closely than do the adults,—just as we have seen
with the breeds of the pigeon&#x200a;....&#x200a;Whatever influence long-continued
use or disuse may have had in modifying the limbs or other parts
of any species, this will chiefly or solely have affected it when
nearly mature, when it was compelled to use its full powers to
gain its own living; and the effects thus produced will have been
transmitted to the offspring at a cor­re­spon­ding nearly mature
age. Thus the young will not be modified, or will be modified
only in a slight degree, through the effects of the increased use or
disuse of parts.” This whole argument is remarkable, in more
ways than we need try to deal with here; but it is especially
remarkable that Darwin should begin by casting doubt upon the
broad fact that a “difference in structure between the embryo
and the adult” is “in some necessary manner contingent on
growth”; and that he should see no reason why complicated
structures of the adult “should not have
been sketched out <span class="xxpn" id="p059">{59}</span>
with all their parts in proper proportion, as soon as any part
became visible.” It would seem to me that even the most
elementary attention to form in its relation to growth would have
removed most of Darwin’s difficulties in regard to the particular
phenomena which he is here considering. For these phenomena
are phenomena of form, and therefore of relative magnitude;
and the magnitudes in question are attained by growth, proceeding
with certain specific velocities, and lasting for certain long periods
of time. And it is accordingly obvious that in any two related
individuals (whether specifically identical or not) the differences
between them must manifest themselves gradually, and be but
little apparent in the young. It is for the same simple reason
that animals which are of very different sizes when adult, differ
less and less in size (as well as in form) as we trace them backwards
through the foetal stages.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Though we study the visible effects of varying rates of growth
throughout wellnigh all the problems of morphology, it is not very
often that we can directly measure the velocities concerned.
But owing to the obvious underlying importance which the
phenomenon has to the morphologist we must make shift to study
it where we can, even though our illustrative cases may seem to
have little immediate bearing on the morphological problem<a class="afnanch" href="#fn93" id="fnanch93">93</a>.</p>

<p>In a very simple organism, of spherical symmetry, such as the
single spherical cell of Protococcus or of Orbulina, growth is
reduced to its simplest terms, and indeed it becomes so simple
in its outward manifestations that it is no longer of special interest
to the morphologist. The rate of growth is measured by the rate
of change in length of a radius, i.e. <i>V</i>
=&#x202f;(<i>R&#xfeff;′</i>
−&#x202f;<i>R</i>)&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>T</i>, and from
this we may calculate, as already indicated, the rate of growth in
terms of surface and of volume. The growing body remains of
constant form, owing to the symmetry of the system; because,
that is to say, on the one hand the pressure exerted by the growing
protoplasm is exerted equally in all directions, after the manner
of a hydrostatic pressure, which indeed it actually is: while on
the other hand, the “skin” or surface layer of
the cell is sufficiently <span class="xxpn" id="p060">{60}</span>
homogeneous to exert at every point an ap­prox­i­mate­ly uniform
resistance. Under these conditions then, the rate of growth is
uniform in all directions, and does not affect the form of the
organism.</p>

<p>But in a larger or a more complex organism the study of growth,
and of the rate of growth, presents us with a variety of problems,
and the whole phenomenon becomes a factor of great morphological
importance. We no longer find that it tends to be uniform in
all directions, nor have we any right to expect that it should.
The resistances which it meets with will no longer be uniform.
In one direction but not in others it will be opposed by the
important resistance of gravity; and within the growing system
itself all manner of structural differences will come into play,
setting up unequal resistances to growth by the varying rigidity
or viscosity of the material substance in one direction or another.
At the same time, the actual sources of growth, the chemical and
osmotic forces which lead to the intussusception of new matter,
are not uniformly distributed; one tissue or one organ may well
manifest a tendency to increase while another does not; a series
of bones, their intervening cartilages, and their surrounding
muscles, may all be capable of very different rates of increment.
The differences of form which are the resultants of these differences
in rate of growth are especially manifested during that part of
life when growth itself is rapid: when the organism, as we say,
is undergoing its <i>development</i>. When growth in general has
become slow, the relative differences in rate between different
parts of the organism may still exist, and may be made manifest
by careful observation, but in many, or perhaps in most cases, the
resultant change of form does not strike the eye. Great as are
the differences between the rates of growth in different parts of
an organism, the marvel is that the ratios between them are so
nicely balanced as they actually are, and so capable, accordingly,
of keeping for long periods of time the form of the growing organism
all but unchanged. There is the nicest possible balance of forces
and resistances in every part of the complex body; and when
this normal equi­lib­rium is disturbed, then we get abnormal
growth, in the shape of tumours, exostoses, and malformations
of every kind. <span class="xxpn" id="p061">{61}</span></p>

<h3><i>The rate of growth in Man.</i></h3>

<p>Man will serve us as well as another organism for our first
illustrations of rate of growth; and we cannot do better than go
for our first data concerning him to Quetelet’s <i>Anthropométrie</i><a class="afnanch" href="#fn94" id="fnanch94">94</a>,
an
epoch-making book for the biologist. For not only is it packed
with information, some of it still unsurpassed, in regard to human
growth and form, but it also merits our highest admiration as the
first great essay in scientific statistics, and the first work in which
organic variation was discussed from the point of view of the
math­e­mat­i­cal theory of probabilities.</p></div>

alt="♂" />);</span>) from Quetelet’s Belgian data. The upper
curve of stature from Bowditch’s Boston data.</div></div>

<p>If the child be some 20 inches, or say 50 cm. tall at birth, and
the man some six feet high, or say 180 cm., at twenty, we may
say that his <i>average</i> rate of growth has been
(180&#x202f;−&#x202f;50)&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;20 cm., or
6·5 centimetres per annum. But we know very
well that this is <span class="xxpn" id="p062">{62}</span>
but a very rough preliminary statement, and that the boy grew
quickly during some, and slowly during other, of his twenty years.
It becomes necessary therefore to study the phenomenon of growth
in successive small portions; to study, that is to say, the successive
lengths, or the successive small differences, or increments, of
length (or of weight, etc.), attained in successive short increments
of time. This we do in the first instance in the usual way, by
the “graphic method” of plotting length against time, and so constructing
our “curve of growth.” Our curve of growth, whether
of weight or length (Fig. <a href="#fig3" title="go to Fig. 3">3</a>), has always a certain char­ac­ter­is­tic
form, or char­ac­ter­is­tic <i>curvature</i>. This is our immediate proof of
the fact that the <i>rate of growth</i> changes as time goes on; for had
it not been so, had an equal increment of length been added in
each equal interval of time, our “curve” would have appeared
as a straight line. Such as it is, it tells us not only that the rate
of growth tends to alter, but that it alters in a definite and orderly
way; for, subject to various minor interruptions, due to secondary
causes, our curves of growth are, on the whole, “smooth” curves.</p>

<p>The curve of growth for length or stature in man indicates
a rapid increase at the outset, that is to say during the quick
growth of babyhood; a long period of slower, but still rapid and
almost steady growth in early boyhood; as a rule a marked
quickening soon after the boy is in his teens, when he comes to
“the growing age”; and finally a gradual arrest of growth as the
boy “comes to his full height,” and reaches manhood.</p>

<p>If we carried the curve further, we should see a very curious thing.
We should see that a man’s full stature endures but for a spell; long
before fifty<a class="afnanch" href="#fn95" id="fnanch95">95</a>
it
has begun to abate, by sixty it is notably lessened, in extreme old
age the old man’s frame is shrunken and it is but a memory that “he
once was tall.” We have already seen, and here we see again, that
growth may have a “negative value.” The phenomenon of negative growth
in old age extends to weight also, and is evidently largely chemical
in origin: the organism can no longer add new material to its fabric
fast enough to keep pace with the wastage of time. Our curve <span
class="xxpn" id="p063">{63}</span> of growth is in fact a diagram
of activity, or “time-energy” diagram<a class="afnanch" href="#fn96"
id="fnanch96">96</a>.
As the organism grows it is absorbing energy
beyond its daily needs, and accumulating it at a rate depicted in

<p class="pcontinue">curve; but the time comes when it accumulates no longer, and at
last it is constrained to draw upon its dwindling store. But in part,
the slow decline in stature is an expression of an unequal contest
between our bodily powers and the
unchanging force of gravity, <span class="xxpn" id="p064">{64}</span>
which draws us down when we would fain rise up<a class="afnanch" href="#fn97" id="fnanch97">97</a>.
For against
gravity we fight all our days, in every movement of our limbs, in
every beat of our hearts; it is the indomitable force that defeats
us in the end, that lays us on our deathbed, that lowers us to the
grave<a class="afnanch" href="#fn98" id="fnanch98">98</a>.</p>

<p>Side by side with the curve which represents growth in length,
or stature, our diagram shows the curve of weight<a class="afnanch" href="#fn99" id="fnanch99">99</a>.
That this
curve is of a very different shape from the former one, is accounted
for in the main (though not wholly) by the fact which we have
already dealt with, that, whatever be the law of increment in a
linear dimension, the law of increase in volume, and therefore in
weight, will be that these latter magnitudes tend to vary as
the cubes of the linear dimensions. This however does not
account for the change of direction, or “point of inflection”
which we observe in the curve of weight at about one or two
years old, nor for certain other differences between our two curves
which the scale of our diagram does not yet make clear. These
differences are due to the fact that the form of the child is altering
with growth, that other linear dimensions are varying somewhat
differently from length or stature, and that consequently the
growth in bulk or weight is following a more complicated law.</p>

<p>Our curve of growth, whether for weight or length, is a direct
picture of velocity, for it represents, as a connected series, the
successive epochs of time at which successive weights or lengths
are attained. But, as we have already in part seen, a great part
of the interest of our curve lies in the fact that we can see from
it, not only that length (or some other magnitude) is changing,
but that the <i>rate of change</i> of magnitude, or rate of growth, is
itself changing. We have, in short, to study the phenomenon of
<i>acceleration</i>: we have begun by studying a
velocity, or rate of <span class="xxpn" id="p065">{65}</span>
change of magnitude; we must now study an acceleration, or
rate of change of velocity. The rate, or velocity, of growth is
measured by the <i>slope</i> of the curve; where the curve is steep, it
means that growth is rapid, and when growth ceases the curve
appears as a horizontal line. If we can find a means, then, of
representing at successive epochs the cor­re­spon­ding slope, or
steepness, of the curve, we shall have obtained a picture of the
rate of change of velocity, or the acceleration of growth. The
measure of the steepness of a curve is given by the tangent to
the curve, or we may estimate it by taking for equal intervals
of time (strictly speaking, for each infinitesimal interval of time)
the actual increment added during that interval of time: and in
practice this simply amounts to taking the successive <i>differences</i>
between the values of length (or of weight) for the successive
ages which we have begun by studying. If we then plot these
successive <i>differences</i> against time, we obtain a curve each point
upon which represents a velocity, and the whole curve indicates
the rate of change of velocity, and we call it an acceleration-curve.
It contains, in truth, nothing whatsoever that was not implicit
in our former curve; but it makes clear to our eye, and brings
within the reach of further in­ves­ti­ga­tion, phenomena that were

<p>The acceleration-curve of height, which we here illustrate, in
Fig. <a href="#fig4" title="go to Fig. 4">4</a>, is very different in form from the curve of growth which
we have just been looking at; and it happens that, in this case,
there is a very marked difference between the curve which we
obtain from Quetelet’s data of growth in height and that which
we may draw from any other series of observations known to me
from British, French, American or German writers. It begins (as
will be seen from our next table) at a very high level, such
as it never afterwards attains; and still stands too high, during
the first three or four years of life, to be represented on the scale
of the accompanying diagram. From these high velocities it falls
away, on the whole, until the age when growth itself ceases, and
when the rate of growth, accordingly, has, for some years together,
the constant value of <i>nil</i>; but the rate of fall, or rate of change of
velocity, is subject to several changes or interruptions. During
the first three or four years of life the fall is
continuous and rapid, <span class="xxpn" id="p066">{66}</span>
but it is somewhat arrested for a while in childhood, from about
five years old to eight. According to Quetelet’s data, there is
another slight interruption in the falling rate between the ages of
about fourteen and sixteen; but in place of this almost insignificant
interruption, the English and other statistics indicate a sudden</p>

<p class="pcontinue">and very marked acceleration of growth beginning at about
twelve years of age, and lasting for three or four years; when
this period of acceleration is over, the rate begins to fall again,
and does so with great rapidity. We do not know how far the
absence of this striking feature in the Belgian curve is due to the
imperfections of Quetelet’s data, or whether it is a real and
significant feature in the small-statured race which he investigated.</p>

<p>The acceleration-curve for man’s weight (Fig.
<a href="#fig5" title="go to Fig. 5">5</a>), whether we
draw it from Quetelet’s data, or from the British, American and
other statistics of later writers, is on the whole similar to that
which we deduce from the statistics of these latter writers in
regard to height or stature; that is to say, it is not a curve which
continually descends, but it indicates a rate of growth which is
subject to important fluctuations at certain epochs of life. We see
that it begins at a high level, and falls
continuously and rapidly<a class="afnanch" href="#fn100" id="fnanch100">100</a>
<span class="xxpn" id="p069">{69}</span>
during the first two or three years of life. After a slight recovery,
it runs nearly level during boyhood from about five to twelve
years old; it then rapidly rises, in the “growing period” of the
early teens, and slowly and steadily falls from about the age of
sixteen onwards. It does not reach the base-line till the man is
about seven or eight and twenty, for normal increase of weight
continues during the years when the man is “filling out,” long
after growth in height has ceased; but at last, somewhere about
thirty, the velocity reaches zero, and even falls below it, for then
the man usually begins to lose weight a little. The subsequent
slow changes in this acceleration-curve we need not stop to deal
with.</p>

<p>In the same diagram (Fig. <a href="#fig5" title="go to Fig. 5">5</a>) I have set forth the acceleration-curves
in respect of increment of weight for both man and woman,
according to Quetelet. That growth in boyhood and growth in
girlhood follow a very different course is a matter of common
knowledge; but if we simply plot the ordinary curve of growth,
or velocity-curve, the difference, on the small scale
of our diagrams, <span class="xxpn" id="p070">{70}</span>
is not very apparent. It is admirably brought out, however, in
the acceleration-curves. Here we see that, after infancy, say
from three years old to eight, the velocity in the girl is steady,
just as in the boy, but it stands on a lower level in her case than
in his: the little maid at this age is growing slower than the boy.
But very soon, and while his acceleration-curve is still represented
by a straight line, hers has begun to ascend, and until the girl
is about thirteen or fourteen it continues to ascend rapidly.
After that age, as after sixteen or seventeen in the boy’s case, it
begins to descend. In short, throughout all this period, it is a very
<i>similar</i> curve in the two sexes; but it has its notable differences,
in amplitude and especially in <i>phase</i>. Last of all, we may notice
that while the acceleration-curve falls to a negative value in the
male about or even a little before the age of thirty years, this
does not happen among women. They continue to grow in
weight, though slowly, till very much later in life; until there
comes a final period, in both sexes alike, during which weight,
and height and strength all alike diminish.</p>

<p>From certain corrected, or “typical” values, given for
American children by Boas and Wissler (<i>l.c.</i> p. 42),
we obtain the following still clearer comparison of the
annual increments of <i>stature</i> in boys and girls: the
typical stature at the commencement of the period, i.e.
at the age of eleven, being 135·1 cm. and 136·9 cm. for
the boys and girls respectively, and the annual increments

<p>The result of these differences (which are essentially <i>phase</i>-differences)
between the two sexes in regard to the velocity of
growth and to the rate of change of that velocity, is to cause the
<i>ratio</i> between the weights of the two sexes to fluctuate in a somewhat
complicated manner. At birth the baby-girl weighs on the
average nearly 10 per cent. less than the boy. Till about two
years old she tends to gain upon him, but she then loses again
until the age of about five; from five she gains for a few years
somewhat rapidly, and the girl of ten to twelve is only some
3 per cent. less in weight than the boy. The boy in
his teens gains <span class="xxpn" id="p071">{71}</span>
steadily, and the young woman of twenty is nearly 15 per cent.
lighter than the man. This ratio of difference again slowly
diminishes, and between fifty and sixty stands at about 12 per
cent., or not far from the mean for all ages; but once more as
old age advances, the difference tends, though very slowly, to
increase (Fig. <a href="#fig6" title="go to Fig. 6">6</a>).</p>

<p>While careful observations on the rate of growth in other animals
are somewhat scanty, they tend to show so far as they go that the
general features of the phenomenon are always much the same. Whether
the animal be long-lived, as man or the elephant, or short-lived,
like horse or dog, it passes through the same phases of growth<a
class="afnanch" href="#fn101" id="fnanch101">101</a>.
In all cases
growth begins slowly; it attains a maximum velocity early in its
course, and afterwards slows down (subject to temporary accelerations)
towards a point where growth ceases altogether. But especially in the
cold-blooded animals, such as fishes, the slowing-down period is very
greatly protracted, and the size of the creature would seem never
actually to reach, but only to approach asymptotically, to a maximal
limit.</p>

<p>The size ultimately attained is a resultant of the rate, and of
<span class="xxpn" id="p072">{72}</span> the duration, of growth. It is
in the main true, as Minot has said, that the rabbit is bigger than the
guinea-pig because he grows the faster; but that man is bigger than the
rabbit because he goes on growing for a longer time.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>In ordinary physical investigations dealing with velocities, as
for instance with the course of a projectile, we pass at once from
the study of acceleration to that of momentum and so to that of
force; for change of momentum, which is proportional to force,
is the product of the mass of a body into its acceleration or change
of velocity. But we can take no such easy road of kinematical
in­ves­ti­ga­tion in this case. The “velocity” of growth is a very
different thing from the “velocity” of the projectile. The forces
at work in our case are not susceptible of direct and easy treatment;
they are too varied in their nature and too indirect in their action
for us to be justified in equating them directly with the mass of
the growing structure.</p>

<div class="psmprnt3">
<p>It was apparently from a feeling that the velocity of
growth ought in some way to be equated with the mass of
the growing structure that Minot<a class="afnanch" href="#fn102" id="fnanch102">102</a>
introduced a curious,
and (as it seems to me) an unhappy method of representing
growth, in the form of what he called “percentage-curves”;
a method which has been followed by a number of other
writers and experimenters. Minot’s method was to deal,
not with the actual increments added in successive
periods, such as years or days, but with these increments
represented as <i>percentages</i> of the amount which had been
reached at the end of the former period. For instance,
taking Quetelet’s values for the height in centimetres of
a male infant from birth to four years old, as follows:</p>

<p class="pcontinue">Minot would state the percentage growth in each of the
four annual periods at 39·6, 13·3, 9·6 and 7·3 per cent.
respectively.</p>

<p>Now when we plot actual length against time, we have a
perfectly definite thing. When we differentiate this
<i>L&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;T</i>, we have <i>dL&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;dT</i>, which is (of course) velocity;

<div class="dmaths">
<p>But when you take percentages of <i>y</i>, you are determining <i>dy&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;y</i>, and when

is to say, you are multiplying the thing you wish to represent by another
quantity which is itself continually varying; and the result is that you are
dealing with something very much less easily grasped by the mind than the
original factors. Professor Minot is, of course, dealing with a perfectly
legitimate function of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>; and his method is practically tantamount to
plotting log&#x202f;<i>y</i> against <i>x</i>, that is to say, the logarithm of the increment against
the time. This could only be defended and justified if it led to some simple
result, for instance if it gave us a straight line, or some other simpler curve

<p>In the acceleration-curves which we have shown above
(Figs. <a href="#fig2" title="go to Fig. 2">2</a>, 3),
it will be seen that the curve starts at a considerable interval from
the actual date of birth; for the first two increments which we can as
yet compare with one another are those attained during the first and
second complete years of life. Now we can in many cases “interpolate”
with safety <i>between</i> known points upon a curve, but it is very
much less safe, and is not very often justifiable (at least until
we understand the physical principle involved, and its math­e­mat­i­cal
expression), to “extrapolate” beyond the limits of our observations. In
short, we do not yet know whether our curve continued to ascend as we
go backwards to the date of birth, or whether it may not have changed
its direction, and descended, perhaps, to zero-value. In regard to
length, or stature, however, we can obtain the requisite information
from certain tables of Rüssow’s<a class="afnanch" href="#fn103"

unimportant epoch in the history of growth. It is an epoch whose

has advanced much farther, than in the case of man; the

scarcely more unformed and embryonic. In all these cases alike,

<p>These data link on very well to those of Rüssow, which we
have just considered, and (though His’s measurements for the
pre-natal months are more detailed than are those of Rüssow for
the first year of post-natal life) we may draw a continuous curve of
growth (Fig. <a href="#fig7" title="go to Fig. 7">7</a>) and curve of acceleration of growth (Fig. <a href="#fig8" title="go to Fig. 8">8</a>) for the
combined periods. It will at once be seen that there is a “point
of inflection” somewhere about the fifth month of intra-uterine
life<a class="afnanch" href="#fn105" id="fnanch105">105</a>:
up to that date growth proceeds with
a continually increasing <span class="xxpn" id="p076">{76}</span>
velocity; but after that date, though growth is still rapid, its
velocity tends to fall away. There is a slight break between our
two separate sets of statistics at the date of birth, while this is
the very epoch regarding which we should particularly like to
have precise and continuous information. Undoubtedly there is
a certain slight arrest of growth, or diminution of the rate of
growth, about the epoch of birth: the
sudden change in the <span class="xxpn" id="p077">{77}</span>
method of nutrition has its inevitable effect; but this slight
temporary set-back is immediately followed by a secondary, and
temporary, acceleration.</p>

<p>It is worth our while to draw a separate curve to illustrate on
a larger scale His’s careful data for the ten months of pre-natal
life (Fig. <a href="#fig9" title="go to Fig. 9">9</a>). We see that this curve of growth is a beautifully
regular one, and is nearly symmetrical on either side of that point
of inflection of which we have already spoken; it is a curve for
which we might well hope to find a simple math­e­mat­i­cal expression.
The acceleration-curve shown in Fig. <a href="#fig9" title="go to Fig. 9">9</a> together with the pre-natal
curve of growth, is not taken directly from His’s recorded data,
but is derived from the tangents drawn to a smoothed curve,
cor­re­spon­ding as nearly as possible to the actual curve of growth:
the rise to a maximal velocity about the fifth month and the
subsequent gradual fall are now demonstrated even more clearly
than before. In Fig. <a href="#fig10" title="go to Fig. 10">10</a>, which is a curve of growth of the
bamboo<a class="afnanch" href="#fn106" id="fnanch106">106</a>,

<h3><i>Variability and Correlation of Growth.</i></h3></div>

<p>The magnitudes and velocities which we are here dealing with
are, of course, mean values derived from a certain number, sometimes
a large number, of individual cases. But no statistical
account of mean values is complete unless we also take account
of the <i>amount of variability</i> among the individual cases from which
the mean value is drawn. To do this throughout would lead us
into detailed investigations which lie far beyond the scope of this
elementary book; but we may very briefly illustrate the nature
of the process, in connection with the phenomena of growth
which we have just been studying.</p>

<p>It was in connection with these phenomena, in the case of
man, that Quetelet first conceived the statistical study of variation,
on lines which were afterwards expounded and developed by
Galton, and which have grown, in the hands of Karl Pearson and
others, into the modern science of Biometrics.</p>

<p>When Quetelet tells us, for instance, that the mean stature
of the ten-year old boy is 1·273 metres, this implies, according to
the law of error, or law of probabilities, that all the individual
measurements of ten-year-old boys group themselves <i>in an orderly
way</i>, that is to say according to a certain definite law, about this
mean value of 1·273. When these individual measurements are
grouped and plotted as a curve, so as to show the number of
individual cases at each individual length, we obtain a char­ac­ter­is­tic
curve of error or curve of frequency; and the “spread” of this
curve is a measure of the amount of variability in this particular
case. A certain math­e­mat­i­cal measure of this “spread,” as
described in works upon statistics, is called the Index of Variability,
or Standard Deviation, and is usually denominated by the letter σ.
It is practically equivalent to a determination of the point upon
the frequency curve where it <i>changes its curvature</i> on either side
of the mean, and where, from being concave towards the middle
line, it spreads out to be convex thereto.
When we divide this <span class="xxpn" id="p079">{79}</span>
value by the mean, we get a figure which is independent of
any particular units, and which is called the Coefficient of Variability.
(It is usually multiplied by 100, to make it of a more
convenient amount; and we may then define this coefficient, <i>C</i>,
as
=&#x202f;(σ&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>M</i>)&#x202f;×&#x202f;100.)</p>

<p>In regard to the growth of man, Pearson has determined this
coefficient of variability as follows: in male new-born infants,
the coefficient in regard to weight is 15·66, and in regard to
stature, 6·50; in male adults, for weight 10·83, and for stature, 3·66.
The amount of variability tends, therefore, to decrease with
growth or age.</p>

<p>Similar determinations have been elaborated by Bowditch, by Boas
and Wissler, and by other writers for intermediate ages, especially
from about five years old to eighteen, so covering a great part of
the whole period of growth in man<a class="afnanch" href="#fn108"

<p>The result is very curious indeed. We see, from Fig. <a href="#fig11" title="go to Fig. 11">11</a>,
that the curve of variability is very similar to what we have called
the acceleration-curve (Fig.
<a href="#fig4" title="go to Fig. 4">4</a>): that is to say, it descends when the
rate of growth diminishes, and rises very markedly again when, in
late boyhood, the rate of growth is
temporarily accelerated. We <span class="xxpn" id="p080">{80}</span>
see, in short, that the amount of <i>variability</i> in stature or in weight
is a function of the <i>rate of growth</i> in these magnitudes, though
we are not yet in a position to equate the terms precisely, one with
another.</p>

<div class="psmprnt2">
<p>If we take not merely the variability of stature or weight at
a given age, but the variability of the actual successive increments
in each yearly period, we see that this latter coefficient of variability
tends to increase steadily, and more and more rapidly, within
the limits of age for which we have information; and this phenomenon
is, in the main, easy of explanation. For a great part of
the difference, in regard to rate of growth, between one individual
and another is a difference of <i>phase</i>,—a difference in the epochs
of acceleration and retardation, and finally in the epoch when
growth comes to an end. And it follows that the variability of
rate will be more and more marked, as we approach and reach
the period when some individuals still continue, and others have
already ceased, to grow. In the
following epitomised table, <span class="xxpn" id="p081">{81}</span>
I have taken Boas’s determinations of variability (σ) (<i>op. cit.</i>
p. 1548), converted them into the cor­re­spon­ding coefficients of
variability (σ&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>M</i>&#x202f;×&#x202f;100), and then
smoothed the resulting numbers.</p>

<p>The greater variability of annual increment in the girls, as
compared with the boys, is very marked, and is easily explained
by the more rapid rate at which the girls run through the several
phases of the phenomenon.</p>

</div><!--psmprnt2-->

<div class="psmprnt3">
<p>Just as there is a marked difference in “phase” between the growth-curves
of the two sexes, that is to say a difference in the periods when growth
is rapid or the reverse, so also, within each sex, will there be room for similar,
but individual phase-differences. Thus we may have children of accelerated
development, who at a given epoch after birth are both rapidly growing and
already “big for their age”; and others of retarded development who are
comparatively small and have not reached the period of acceleration which,
in greater or less degree, will come to them in turn. In other words, there
must under such circumstances be a strong positive “coefficient of correlation”
between stature and rate of growth, and also between the rate of growth in
one year and the next. But it does not by any means follow that a child who
is precociously big will continue to grow rapidly, and become a man or woman
of exceptional stature. On the contrary, when in the case of the precocious
or “accelerated” children growth has begun to slow down, the backward
ones may still be growing rapidly, and so making up (more or less completely)
to the others. In other words, the period of high positive correlation between
stature and increment will tend to be followed by one of negative correlation.
This interesting and important point, due to Boas and
Wissler<a class="afnanch" href="#fn109" id="fnanch109">109</a>,
is confirmed

<p>A minor, but very curious point brought out by the same investigators
is that, if instead of stature we deal with height in the sitting posture (or,
practically speaking, with length of trunk or back), then the correlations
between this height and its annual increment are throughout negative. In
other words, there would seem to be a general tendency for the long trunks
to grow slowly throughout the whole period under in­ves­ti­ga­tion. It is a
well-known anatomical fact that tallness is in the main due not to length of
body but to length of limb.</p>
</div><!--psmprnt2-->

<p>The whole phenomenon of variability in regard to magnitude
and to rate of increment is in the highest degree suggestive:
inasmuch as it helps further to remind and to impress upon us
that specific rate of growth is the real physiological factor which
we want to get at, of which specific magnitude, dimensions and
form, and all the variations of these, are merely the concrete and
visible resultant. But the problems of variability, though they
are intimately related to the general problem of growth, carry us
very soon beyond our present limitations.</p>

<h3 title="Rate of growth in other organisms."><i>Rate of growth in other
organisms<a class="afnanchlow" href="#fn110" id="fnanch110" title="go to

<p>Just as the human curve of growth has its slight but well-marked
interruptions, or variations in rate, coinciding with such
epochs as birth and puberty, so is it with other animals, and this
phenomenon is particularly striking in the case of animals which
undergo a regular metamorphosis.</p>

<p>In the accompanying curve of growth in weight of the mouse
(Fig. <a href="#fig12" title="go to Fig. 12">12</a>), based on W. Ostwald’s observations<a class="afnanch" href="#fn111" id="fnanch111">111</a>,
we see a distinct
slackening of the rate when the mouse is about a fortnight old,
at which period it opens its eyes and very soon afterwards is
weaned. At about six weeks old there is another well-marked
retardation of growth, following on a very rapid period, and
coinciding with the epoch of puberty. <span class="xxpn" id="p083">{83}</span></p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig13" title="go to Fig. 13">13</a> shews the curve of growth of the silkworm<a class="afnanch" href="#fn112" id="fnanch112">112</a>,
during its
whole larval life, up to the time of its entering the chrysalis stage.</p>

<p>The silkworm moults four times, at intervals of about a week,
the first moult being on the sixth or seventh day after hatching.
A distinct retardation of growth is exhibited on our curve in the
case of the third and fourth moults; while a similar retardation
accompanies the first and second moults also, but the scale of
our diagram does not render it visible. When the worm is about
seven weeks old, a remarkable process of “purgation” takes place,
as a preliminary to entering on the pupal, or chrysalis, stage;
and the great and sudden loss of weight which accompanies this
process is the most marked feature of our curve.</p>

<p>The rate of growth in the tadpole<a class="afnanch" href="#fn113" id="fnanch113">113</a>
(Fig. <a href="#fig14" title="go to Fig. 14">14</a>) is likewise marked
by epochs of retardation, and finally by a sudden and drastic
change. There is a slight diminution in
weight immediately after <span class="xxpn" id="p084">{84}</span>
the little larva frees itself from the egg; there is a retardation of
growth about ten days later, when the external gills disappear;
and finally, the complete metamorphosis, with the loss of the tail,
the growth of the legs and the cessation of branchial respiration,
is accompanied by a loss of weight amounting to wellnigh half
the weight of the full-grown larva. <span class="xxpn" id="p085">{85}</span></p>

<p>While as a general rule, the better the animals be fed the
quicker they grow and the sooner they metamorphose, Barfürth
has pointed out the curious fact that a short spell of starvation,
just before metamorphosis is due, appears to hasten the change.</p>

<p>The negative growth, or actual loss of bulk and weight
which often, and perhaps always, accompanies metamorphosis,
is well shewn in the case of the eel<a class="afnanch" href="#fn114" id="fnanch114">114</a>.
The contrast of
size is great between <span class="xxpn" id="p087">{87}</span>
the flattened, lancet-shaped Leptocephalus larva and the little
black cylindrical, almost thread-like elver, whose magnitude is
less than that of the Leptocephalus in every dimension, even, at
first, in length (Fig. <a href="#fig15" title="go to Fig. 15">15</a>).</p>

<p>From the higher study of the physiology of growth we learn
that such fluctuations as we have described are but special interruptions
in a process which is never actually continuous, but is
perpetually interrupted in a rhythmic manner<a class="afnanch" href="#fn115" id="fnanch115">115</a>.
Hofmeister
shewed, for instance, that the growth of Spirogyra proceeds by
fits and starts, by periods of activity and rest, which alternate
with one another at intervals of so many minutes (Fig. <a href="#fig16" title="go to Fig. 16">16</a>). And
Bose, by very refined methods of experiment, has shewn that
plant-growth really proceeds by tiny and perfectly rhythmical
pulsations recurring at regular intervals of a few seconds of time.
Fig. <a href="#fig17" title="go to Fig. 17">17</a> shews, according to Bose’s observations<a class="afnanch" href="#fn116" id="fnanch116">116</a>,
the growth of
a crocus, under a very high magnification. The stalk grows by
little jerks, each with an amplitude of
about ·002 mm., every <span class="xxpn" id="p088">{88}</span>
twenty seconds or so, and after each little increment there is a
partial recoil.</p>

<p>From the first portion of the table, it will be seen that none
of these organs by any means keep pace with the body as a whole
in regard to growth in weight; in other words, there must be
some other part of the fabric, doubtless the muscles and the bones,
which increase <i>more</i> rapidly than the average increase of the body.
Heart and liver both grow nearly at the same rate,
and by the <span class="xxpn" id="p090">{90}</span>
age of twenty-five they have multiplied their weight at birth by
about thirteen times, while the weight of the entire body has been
multiplied by about twenty-one; but the weight of the brain has
meanwhile been multiplied only about three and a quarter times.
In the next place, we see the very remarkable phenomenon that
the brain, growing rapidly till the child is about four years old, then
grows more much slowly till about eight or nine years old, and
after that time there is scarcely any further perceptible increase.
These phenomena are dia­gram­ma­ti­cally illustrated in Fig. <a href="#fig18" title="go to Fig. 18">18</a>.</p>

<div class="dctr02" id="fig18">
<img src="images/i090.png" width="750" height="624" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 18. Relative growth in weight (in Man) of
 Brain, Heart, and whole Body.</div></div>

<div class="psmprnt3">
<p>Many statistics indicate a decrease of brain-weight during adult
life. Boas<a class="afnanch" href="#fn119" id="fnanch119">119</a>
was
inclined to attribute this apparent phenomenon to our statistical
methods, and to hold that it could “hardly be explained in any other
way than by assuming an increased death-rate among men with very large
brains, at an age of about twenty years.” But Raymond Pearl has shewn
that there is evidence of a steady and very gradual decline in the
weight of the brain with advancing age, beginning at or before the
twentieth year, and continuing throughout adult life<a class="afnanch"
href="#fn120" id="fnanch120">120</a>.
<span class="xxpn"
id="p091">{91}</span></p></div><!--psmprnt3-->

<p>The second part of the table shews the steadily decreasing
weights of the organs in question as compared with the body;
the brain falling from over 12 per cent. at birth to little over
2 per cent. at five and twenty; the heart from ·75 to ·46 per
cent.; and the liver from 4·57 to 2·75 per cent. of the whole
bodily weight.</p>

<p>It is plain, then, that there is no simple and direct relation,
holding good <i>throughout life</i>, between the size of the body as a
whole and that of the organs we have just discussed; and the
changing ratio of magnitude is especially marked in the case of
the brain, which, as we have just seen, constitutes about one-eighth
of the whole bodily weight at birth, and but one-fiftieth at five
and twenty. The same change of ratio is observed in other
animals, in equal or even greater degree. For instance, Max
Weber<a class="afnanch" href="#fn121" id="fnanch121">121</a>
tells us that in the lion, at five weeks, four months,
eleven months, and lastly when full-grown, the brain-weight
represents the following fractions of the weight of the whole
body, viz. 1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;18, 1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;80, 1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;184, and 1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;546. And Kellicott has, in
like manner, shewn that in the dogfish, while some organs (e.g.
rectal gland, pancreas, etc.) increase steadily and very nearly
proportionately to the body as a whole, the brain, and some other
organs also, grow in a diminishing ratio, which is capable of
representation, ap­prox­i­mate­ly, by a logarithmic curve<a class="afnanch" href="#fn122" id="fnanch122">122</a>.</p>

<p>But if we confine ourselves to the adult, then, as Raymond
Pearl has shewn in the case of man, the relation of brain-weight
to age, to stature, or to weight, becomes a comparatively simple
one, and may be sensibly expressed by a straight line, or simple
equation.</p>

<div class="psmprnt2">
<div class="dmaths">
<p>Thus, if <i>W</i> be the brain-weight (in grammes), and <i>A</i> be the
age, or <i>S</i> the stature, of the individual, then (in the case of Swedish
males) the following simple equations suffice to give the required
ratios:</p>

<div><i>W</i>
=&#x202f;1487·8&#x202f;−&#x202f;1·94&#x200a;<i>A</i>
=&#x202f;915·06&#x202f;+&#x202f;2·86&#x200a;<i>S</i>.</div>

<p class="pcontinue" id="p092">These equations are
applicable to ages between fifteen and eighty; if we take
narrower limits, say between fifteen and fifty, we can get
a closer agreement by using somewhat altered constants.
In the two sexes, and in different races, these empirical
constants will be greatly changed<a class="afnanch"
href="#fn123" id="fnanch123">123</a>. Donaldson has further
shewn that the correlation between brain-weight and
body-weight is very much closer in the rat than in man<a
class="afnanch" href="#fn124" id="fnanch124">124</a>.</p>
</div><!--dmaths--></div><!--psmprnt2-->

<div class="psmprnt3">
<p>The falling ratio of weight of brain to body with increase of size or age
finds its parallel in comparative anatomy, in the general law that the larger
the animal the less is the relative weight of the brain.</p>

<p>For much information on this subject, see Dubois, “Abhängigkeit des
Hirngewichtes von der Körpergrösse bei den Säugethieren,” <i>Arch. f.
Anthropol.</i> <span class="smmaj">XXV,</span> 1897. Dubois has attempted,
but I think with very doubtful success, to equate the weight of the
brain with that of the animal. We may do this, in a very simple way, by
representing the weight of the body as a <i>power</i> of that of the brain;
thus, in the above table of the weights of brain and body in four
species of cat, if we call <i>W</i> the weight of the body (in grammes), and
<i>w</i> the weight of the brain, then if in all four cases we express the
ratio by <i>W</i>
=&#x202f;<i>w</i>&#xfeff;<sup class="spitc">n</sup>&#x202f;, we find that <i>n</i> is almost
constant, and differs little from 2·24 in all four species: the values
being respectively, in the order of the table 2·36, 2·24, 2·18, and
2·17. But this evidently amounts to no more than an empirical rule;
for we can easily see that it depends on the particular scale which we
have used, and that if the weights had been taken, for instance, in
kilogrammes or in milligrammes, the agreement or coincidence would not
have occurred<a class="afnanch" href="#fn125" id="fnanch125">125</a>.

<p>As regards external form, very similar differences exist, which
however we must express in terms not of weight but of length.
Thus the annexed table shews the changing ratios of the vertical
length of the head to the entire stature; and while this ratio
constantly diminishes, it will be seen that the rate of change is
greatest (or the coefficient of acceleration highest) between the
ages of about two and five years.</p>

<p>In one of Quetelet’s tables (<i>supra</i>, p. 63), he gives measurements
of the total span of the outstretched arms in man, from
year to year, compared with the vertical stature. The two
measurements are so nearly identical in actual magnitude that a
direct comparison by means of curves becomes unsatisfactory;
but I have reduced Quetelet’s data to percentages, and it will be
seen from Fig. <a href="#fig19" title="go to Fig. 19">19</a> that the percentage proportion of span to
height undergoes a remarkable and steady change from birth to
the age of twenty years; the man grows more rapidly in stretch
of arms than he does in height, and the
span which was less than <span class="xxpn" id="p094">{94}</span>
the stature at birth by about 1 per cent. exceeds it at the age of
twenty by about 4 per cent. After the age of twenty, Quetelet’s
data are few and irregular, but it is clear that the span goes on
for a long while increasing in proportion to the stature. How
far the phenomenon is due to actual growth of the arms and
how far to the increasing breadth of the chest is not yet
ascertained.</p>

<p>While it is inequality of growth in <i>different</i> directions that we
can most easily comprehend as a phenomenon leading to gradual change
of outward form, we shall see in another chapter<a class="afnanch"
href="#fn127" id="fnanch127">127</a>
that differences of rate at
different parts of a longitudinal system, though always in the same
direction, also lead to very notable and regular trans­for­ma­tions. Of
this phenomenon, the difference in rate of longitudinal growth between
head and body is a simple case, and the difference which accompanies
and results from it in the bodily form of the child and the man is
easy to see. A like phenomenon has been studied in much greater detail
in the case of plants, by Sachs and certain other botanists, after
a method in use by Stephen Hales a hundred and fifty years before<a
class="afnanch" href="#fn128" id="fnanch128">128</a>.</p>

<p>On the growing root of a bean, ten narrow zones were marked
off, starting from the apex, each zone a millimetre in breadth.
After twenty-four hours’ growth, at a certain constant temperature,
the whole marked portion had grown from 10 mm. to 33 mm. in
length; but the individual zones had grown at very unequal rates,
as shewn in the annexed table<a class="afnanch" href="#fn129"

 <div class="pcaption">Fig. 20. Rate of growth in successive zones
 near the tip of the bean-root.</div></div>

<p>The several values in this table lie very nearly (as we see by
Fig. <a href="#fig20" title="go to Fig. 20">20</a>) in a smooth curve; in other words a definite law, or
principle of continuity, connects the rates of growth at successive
points along the growing axis of the root. Moreover this curve,
in its general features, is singularly like those acceleration-curves
which we have already studied, in which we plotted the rate of
growth against successive intervals of time, as here we have
plotted it against successive spatial intervals of an actual growing
structure. If we suppose for a moment that the velocities of
growth had been transverse to the axis, instead of, as in this case,
longitudinal and parallel with it, it is obvious that these same
velocities would have given us a leaf-shaped structure, of which
our curve in Fig. <a href="#fig20" title="go to Fig. 20">20</a> (if drawn to a suitable scale) would represent
the actual outline on either side of the median axis; or, again,
if growth had been not confined to one plane but symmetrical
about the axis, we should have had a sort
of turnip-shaped root, <span class="xxpn" id="p097">{97}</span>
having the form of a surface of revolution generated by the same
curve. This then is a simple and not unimportant illustration of
the direct and easy passage from velocity to form.</p>

<div class="psmprnt3">
<p>A kindred problem occurs when, instead of “zones” artificially marked
out in a stem, we deal with the rates of growth in successive actual
“internodes”; and an interesting variation of this problem occurs when
we consider, not the actual growth of the internodes, but the varying
number of leaves which they successively produce. Where we have whorls
of leaves at each node, as in Equisetum and in many water-weeds, then
the problem presents itself in a simple form, and in one such case,
namely in Ceratophyllum, it has been carefully investigated by Mr
Raymond Pearl<a class="afnanch" href="#fn130" id="fnanch130">130</a>.</p>

<p>It is found that the mean number of leaves per whorl increases with
each successive whorl; but that the rate of increment diminishes from
whorl to whorl, as we ascend the axis. In other words, the increase in
the number of leaves per whorl follows a logarithmic ratio; and if <i>y</i>
be the mean number of leaves per whorl, and <i>x</i> the successional number
of the whorl from the root or main stem upwards, then</p>

<div class="maths">
<i>y</i>
=&#x202f;<i>A</i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;<i>C</i>&#x200a;log(<i>x</i>&#x202f;−&#x202f;<i>a</i>),
</div><!--maths-->

<p class="pcontinue">where <i>A</i>, <i>C</i>, and <i>a</i> are certain specific
constants, varying with the part of the plant which we happen to be
considering. On the main stem, the rate of change in the number of
leaves per whorl is very slow; when we come to the small twigs, or
“tertiary branches,” it has become rapid, as we see from the following
abbreviated table:</p>

<p>We have seen that a slow but definite change of form is a common
accompaniment of increasing age, and is brought about as the simple
and natural result of an altered ratio between the rates of growth in
different dimensions: or rather by the progressive change necessarily
brought about by the difference in their accelerations. There are many
cases however in which the change is all but imperceptible to ordinary
measurement, and many others in which some one dimension is easily
measured, but others are hard to measure with cor­re­spon­ding accuracy.
<span class="xxpn" id="p098">{98}</span> For instance, in any ordinary
fish, such as a plaice or a haddock, the length is not difficult to
measure, but measurements of breadth or depth are very much more
uncertain. In cases such as these, while it remains difficult to define
the precise nature of the change of form, it is easy to shew that
such a change is taking place if we make use of that ratio of length
to weight which we have spoken of in the preceding chapter. Assuming,
as we may fairly do, that weight is directly proportional to bulk or
volume, we may express this relation in the form <i>W&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;L</i>&#xfeff;<sup>3</sup>
=&#x202f;<i>k</i>, where <i>k</i> is a constant, to be determined for each
particular case. (<i>W</i> and <i>L</i> are expressed in grammes and centimetres,
and it is usual to multiply the result by some figure, such as 1000, so
as to give the constant <i>k</i> a value near to unity.)</p>

<p>Now while this <i>k</i> may be spoken of as a “constant,” having
a certain mean value specific to each species of organism, and
depending on the form of the organism, any change to which it
may be subject will be a very delicate index of progressive changes
of form; for we know that our measurements of length are, on
the average, very accurate, and weighing is a still more delicate
method of comparison than any linear measurement.</p>

<div class="dctr03" id="fig21">
<img src="images/i099.png" width="600" height="412" alt="" />
 <div class="pcaption">Fig. 21. Changes in the weight-length ratio
 of Plaice, with increasing size.</div></div>

<p>Thus, in the case of plaice, when we deal with the mean values
for a large number of specimens, and when we are careful to deal
only with such as are caught in a particular locality and at a particular
time, we see that <i>k</i> is by no means constant, but steadily
increases to a maximum, and afterwards slowly declines with the
increasing size of the fish (Fig. <a href="#fig21" title="go to Fig. 21">21</a>). To begin with, therefore, the
weight is increasing more rapidly than the cube of the length, and
it follows that the length itself is increasing less rapidly than some
other linear dimension; while in later life this condition is reversed.
The maximum is reached when the length of the fish is somewhere
near to 30 cm., and it is tempting to suppose that with this “point
of inflection” there is associated some well-marked epoch in the
fish’s life. As a matter of fact, the size of 30 cm. is ap­prox­i­mate­ly
that at which sexual maturity may be said to begin, or is at least
near enough to suggest a close connection between the two
phenomena. The first step towards further
in­ves­ti­ga­tion of the <span class="xxpn" id="p100">{100}</span>
apparent coincidence would be to determine the coefficient <i>k</i> of
the two sexes separately, and to discover whether or not the point
of inflection is reached (or sexual maturity is reached) at a smaller
size in the male than in the female plaice; but the material for
this in­ves­ti­ga­tion is at present scanty.</p>

<img src="images/i100.png" width="700" height="671" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 22. Periodic annual change
 in the weight-length ratio of Plaice.</div></div>

<p>A still more curious and more unexpected result appears when
we compare the values of <i>k</i> for the same fish at different seasons of
the year<a class="afnanch" href="#fn131" id="fnanch131">131</a>.
When for simplicity’s sake (as in the accompanying
table and Fig. <a href="#fig22" title="go to Fig. 22">22</a>) we restrict ourselves to fish of one particular
size, it is not necessary to determine the value of <i>k</i>, because a
change in the ratio of length to weight is obvious enough; but
when we have small numbers, and various sizes, to deal with,
the determination of <i>k</i> may help us very much. It will be seen,
then, that in the case of plaice the ratio of weight to length
exhibits a regular periodic variation with the
course of the seasons. <span class="xxpn" id="p101">{101}</span></p>

<p class="pcontinue">With unchanging length, the weight and therefore the bulk of the
fish falls off from about November to March or April, and again
between May or June and November the bulk and weight are
gradually restored. The explanation is simple, and depends
wholly on the process of spawning, and on the subsequent building
up again of the tissues and the reproductive organs. It follows
that, by this method, without ever seeing a fish spawn, and without
ever dissecting one to see the state of its reproductive system, we
can ascertain its spawning season, and determine the beginning
and end thereof, with great accuracy.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>As a final illustration of the rate of growth, and of unequal
growth in various directions, I give the following table of data
regarding the ox, extending over the first three years, or nearly
so, of the animal’s life. The observed data are (1) the weight of
the animal, month by month, (2) the length of the back, from the
occiput to the root of the tail, and (3) the height to the withers.
To these data I have added (1) the ratio of length to height,
(2) the coefficient (<i>k</i>) expressing the ratio of weight to the cube of
the length, and (3) a similar coefficient (<i>k&#xfeff;′</i>) for the height of the
animal. It will be seen that, while all these ratios tend to alter
continuously, shewing that the animal’s form is steadily altering
as it approaches maturity, the ratio between
length and weight <span class="xxpn" id="p102">{102}</span>
changes comparatively little. The simple ratio between length
and height increases considerably, as indeed we should expect;
for we know that in all Ungulate animals the legs are remarkably</p>

<p class="pcontinue">long at birth in comparison with other dimensions of the body.
It is somewhat curious, however, that this ratio seems to fall off
a little in the third year of growth, the animal continuing to grow
in height to a marked degree after growth in length has become
very slow. The ratio between height and weight is by much the
most variable of our three ratios; the coefficient <i>W&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;H</i>&#xfeff;<sup>3</sup> steadily
increases, and is more than twice as great at three years old as
it was at birth. This illustrates the important, but obvious fact,
that the coefficient <i>k</i> is most variable in the case of that
dimension which grows most uniformly, that is to say most nearly
in proportion to the general bulk of the animal. In short, the
successive values of <i>k</i>, as determined (at successive epochs) for
one dimension, are a measure of the <i>variability</i> of the others.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>From the whole of the foregoing discussion we see that a certain
definite rate of growth is a char­ac­ter­is­tic or specific phenomenon,
deep-seated in the physiology of the organism; and that a very
large part of the specific morphology of the organism depends upon
the fact that there is not only an average, or aggregate, rate of
growth common to the whole, but also a variation of rate in
different parts of the organism, tending towards a specific rate
char­ac­ter­is­tic of each different part or organ. The smallest change
in the relative magnitudes of these partial or localised velocities
of growth will be soon manifested in more and more striking
differences of form. This is as much as to say that the time-element,
which is implicit in the idea of growth, can never (or
very seldom) be wholly neglected in our consideration of
form<a class="afnanch" href="#fn132" id="fnanch132">132</a>.
It is scarcely necessary to enlarge here upon our statement, for
not only is the truth of it self-evident, but it will find illustration
again and again throughout this book. Nevertheless, let us go
out of our way for a moment to consider it in reference to a
particular case, and to enquire whether it helps to remove any of
the difficulties which that case appears
to present. <span class="xxpn" id="p104">{104}</span></p>

 <div class="pcaption">Fig. 23. Variability of length of
 tail-forceps in a sample of Earwigs. (After Bateson, <i>P. Z.
 S.</i> 1892, p. 588.)</div></div>

<p>In a very well-known paper, Bateson shewed that, among a
large number of earwigs, collected in a particular locality, the
males fell into two groups, characterised by large or by small
tail-forceps, with very few instances of intermediate magnitude.
This distribution into two groups, according to magnitude, is
illustrated in the accompanying diagram (Fig. <a href="#fig23" title="go to Fig. 23">23</a>); and the
phenomenon was described, and has been often quoted, as one
of dimorphism, or discontinuous variation. In this diagram the
time-element does not appear; but it is certain, and evident, that
it lies close behind. Suppose we take some organism which is
born not at all times of the year (as man is) but at some one
particular season (for instance a fish), then any random sample
will consist of individuals whose <i>ages</i>, and therefore whose <i>magnitudes</i>,
will form a discontinuous series; and by plotting these
magnitudes on a curve in relation to the number of individuals
of each particular magnitude, we obtain a curve such as that
shewn in Fig. <a href="#fig24" title="go to Fig. 24">24</a>, the first practical use of which is to enable us
to analyse our sample into its constituent “age-groups,” or in
other words to determine ap­prox­i­mate­ly the age, or ages of the
fish. And if, instead of measuring the whole length of our fish,
we had confined ourselves to particular parts, such
as head, or <span class="xxpn" id="p105">{105}</span>
tail or fin, we should have obtained discontinuous curves of
distribution, precisely analogous to those for the entire animal.
Now we know that the differences with which Bateson was dealing
were entirely a question of magnitude, and we cannot help seeing
that the discontinuous distributions of magnitude represented by
his earwigs’ tails are just such as are illustrated by the magnitudes
of the older and younger fish; we may indeed go so far as to say
that the curves are precisely comparable, for in both cases we see
a char­ac­ter­is­tic feature of detail, namely that the “spread” of the
curve is greater in the second wave than in the first, that is to
say (in the case of the fish) in the older as well as larger series.
Over the reason for this phenomenon, which is simple and all but
obvious, we need not pause.</p>

<div class="dctr03" id="fig24">
<img src="images/i105.png" width="600" height="444" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 24. Variability of length
 of body in a sample of Plaice.</div></div>

<p>It is evident, then, that in this case of “dimorphism,” the tails
of the one group of earwigs (which Bateson calls the “high males”)
have either grown <i>faster</i>, or have been growing for a longer period
of time, than those of the “low males.” If we could be certain
that the whole random sample of earwigs were of one and the
same age, then we should have to refer the phenomenon of dimorphism
to a physiological phenomenon, simple in kind (however
remarkable and unexpected); viz. that there
were two alternative <span class="xxpn" id="p106">{106}</span>
values, very different from one another, for the mean velocity of
growth, and that the individual earwigs varied around one or
other of these mean values, in each case according to the law of
probabilities. But on the other hand, if we could believe that
the two groups of earwigs were <i>of different ages</i>, then the phenomenon
would be simplicity itself, and there would be no more to
be said about it<a class="afnanch" href="#fn133" id="fnanch133">133</a>.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Before we pass from the subject of the relative rate of growth of
different parts or organs, we may take brief note of the fact that
various experiments have been made to determine whether the normal
ratios are maintained under altered circumstances of nutrition, and
especially in the case of partial starvation. For instance, it has been
found possible to keep young rats alive for many weeks on a diet such
as is just sufficient to maintain life without permitting any increase
of weight. The rat of three weeks old weighs about 25 gms., and under a
normal diet should weigh at ten weeks old about 150 gms., in the male,
or 115 gms. in the female; but the underfed rat is still kept at ten
weeks old to the weight of 25 gms. Under normal diet the proportions
of the body change very considerably between the ages of three and ten
weeks. For instance the tail gets relatively longer; and even when the
<i>total</i> growth of the rat is prevented by underfeeding, the <i>form</i>
continues to alter so that this increasing length of the tail is still
manifest<a class="afnanch" href="#fn134" id="fnanch134">134</a>.

<p>Again as physiologists have long been aware, there is a marked
difference in the variation of weight of the different organs,
according to whether the animal’s total weight remain constant,
or be caused to diminish by actual starvation; and further striking
differences appear when the diet is not only scanty, but ill-balanced.
But these phenomena of abnormal growth, however interesting
from the physiological view, are of little practical importance to
the morphologist.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3><i>The effect of temperature<a class="afnanchlow" href="#fn135"
id="fnanch135" title="go to note 135">*</a>.</i></h3></div>

<p>The rates of growth which we have hitherto dealt with are based on
special investigations, conducted under particular local conditions.
For instance, Quetelet’s data, so far as we have used them to
illustrate the rate of growth in man, are drawn from his study of the
population of Belgium. But apart from that “fortuitous” individual
variation which we have already considered, it is obvious that the
normal rate of growth will be found to vary, in man and in other
animals, just as the average stature varies, in different localities,
and in different “races.” This phenomenon is a very complex one, and is
doubtless a resultant of many undefined contributory causes; but we at
least gain something in regard to it, when we discover that the rate
of growth is directly affected by temperature, and probably by other
physical <span class="xxpn" id="p108">{108}</span> conditions. Réaumur
was the first to shew, and the observation was repeated by Bonnet<a
class="afnanch" href="#fn136" id="fnanch136">136</a>,
that the rate
of growth or development of the chick was dependent on temperature,
being retarded at temperatures below and somewhat accelerated at
temperatures above the normal temperature of incubation, that is
to say the temperature of the sitting hen. In the case of plants
the fact that growth is greatly affected by temperature is a matter
of familiar knowledge; the subject was first carefully studied by
Alphonse De Candolle, and his results and those of his followers are
discussed in the textbooks of Botany<a class="afnanch" href="#fn137"
id="fnanch137">137</a>.</p>

<div class="psmprnt3">
<p>That variation of temperature constitutes only one factor in
determining the rate of growth is admirably illustrated in the case
of the Bamboo. It has been stated (by Lock) that in Ceylon the rate
of growth of the Bamboo is directly proportional to the humidity of
the atmosphere: and again (by Shibata) that in Japan it is directly
proportional to the temperature. The two statements have been
ingeniously and satisfactorily reconciled by Blackman<a class="afnanch"
href="#fn138" id="fnanch138">138</a>,
who suggests that in Ceylon the
temperature-conditions are all that can be desired, but moisture is
apt to be deficient: while in Japan there is rain in abundance but the
average temperature is somewhat too low. So that in the one country it
is the one factor, and in the other country it is the other, which is
<i>essentially</i> variable.</p>
</div><!--psmprnt3-->

<p>The annexed diagram (Fig. <a href="#fig25" title="go to Fig. 25">25</a>), shewing the growth in length
of the roots of some common plants during an identical period
of forty-eight hours, at temperatures varying from about 14° to
37° C., is a sufficient illustration of the phenomenon. We see that
in all cases there is a certain optimum temperature at which the
rate of growth is a maximum, and we can also see that on either
side of this optimum temperature the acceleration of growth,
positive or negative, with increase of temperature is rapid, while
at a distance from the optimum it is very slow. From the
data given by Sachs and others, we see further that this optimum
temperature is very much the same for all the common plants of
our own climate which have as yet been studied;
in them it is <span class="xxpn" id="p109">{109}</span>
somewhere about 26° C. (or say 77° F.), or about the temperature
of a warm summer’s day; while it is found, very naturally, to be
considerably higher in the case of plants such as the melon or the
maize, which are at home in warmer regions that our own.</p>

<p>In a large number of physical phenomena, and in a very marked degree
in all chemical reactions, it is found that rate of action is affected,
and for the most part accelerated, by rise of temperature; and this
effect of temperature tends to follow a definite “exponential” law,
which holds good within a considerable range of temperature, but is
altered or departed from when we pass beyond certain normal limits. The
law, as laid down by van’t Hoff for chemical reactions, is, that for
an interval of <i>n</i> degrees the velocity varies as
<i>x</i>&#xfeff;<sup><i>n</i></sup>&#x202f;,
<i>x</i> being called the “temperature coefficient”<a class="afnanch"
href="#fn139" id="fnanch139">139</a>
for the reaction in question.
<span class="xxpn" id="p110">{110}</span></p>

<p>Van’t Hoff’s law, which has become a fundamental principle
of chemical mechanics, is likewise applicable (with certain qualifications)
to the phenomena of vital chemistry; and it follows that,
on very much the same lines, we may speak of the “temperature
coefficient” of growth. At the same time we must remember
that there is a very important difference (though we can scarcely
call it a <i>fundamental</i> one) between the purely physical and the
physiological phenomenon, in that in the former we study (or
seek and profess to study) one thing at a time, while in the latter
we have always to do with various factors which intersect and
interfere; increase in the one case (or change of any kind) tends
to be continuous, in the other case it tends to be brought to arrest.
This is the simple meaning of that <i>Law of Optimum</i>, laid down by
Errera and by Sachs as a general principle of physiology: namely
that <i>every</i> physiological process which varies (like growth itself)
with the amount or intensity of some external influence, does so
according to a law in which progressive increase is followed by
progressive decrease; in other words the function has its <i>optimum</i>
condition, and its curve shews a definite <i>maximum</i>. In the case
of temperature, as Jost puts it, it has on the one hand its accelerating
effect which tends to follow van’t Hoff’s law. But it has also
another and a cumulative effect upon the organism: “Sie schädigt
oder sie ermüdet ihn, und je höher sie steigt, desto rascher macht
sie die Schädigung geltend und desto schneller schreitet sie voran.”
It would seem to be this double effect of temperature in the case
of the organism which gives us our “optimum” curves, which are
the expression, accordingly, not of a primary phenomenon, but
of a more or less complex resultant. Moreover, as Blackman and
others have pointed out, our “optimum” temperature is very
ill-defined until we take account also of the <i>duration</i> of our experiment;
for obviously, a high temperature may lead to a short,
but exhausting, spell of rapid growth, while the slower rate
manifested at a lower temperature may be
the best in the end. <span class="xxpn" id="p111">{111}</span>
The mile and the hundred yards are won by different runners;
and maximum rate of working, and maximum amount of work

<p>This first approximation might be considerably improved by
taking account of all the experimental values, two only of
which we have as yet made use of; but even as it is, we see
by Fig. <a href="#fig26" title="go to Fig. 26">26</a> that it is in very fair accordance with the actual
results of observation, <i>within those particular limits</i>
of temperature to which the experiment is confined. <span

<p>For an experiment on <i>Lupinus albus</i>, quoted by Asa
Gray<a class="afnanch" href="#fn142" id="fnanch142">142</a>,
I have worked out the cor­re­spon­ding coefficient, but a little
more carefully. Its value I find to be 1·16, or very nearly
identical with that we have just found for the maize; and the
cor­re­spon­dence between the calculated curve and the actual
observations is now a close one.</p>

<div class="psmprnt3">
<p>Since the above paragraphs were written, new data have come to
hand. Miss I. Leitch has made careful observations of the rate
of growth of rootlets of the Pea; and I have attempted a further
analysis of her principal results<a class="afnanch" href="#fn143"
id="fnanch143">143</a>.
In Fig. <a href="#fig27" title="go to Fig. 27">27</a> are shewn the mean rates of
growth (based on about a hundred experiments) at some thirty-four
different temperatures between 0·8° and 29·3°, each experiment lasting
rather less than twenty-four hours. Working out the mean temperature
coefficient for a great many combinations of these values, I obtain
a value of 1·092 per C.°, or 2·41 for an interval of 10°, and a mean
value for the whole series showing a rate of growth of just about 1 mm.
per hour at a temperature of 20°. My curve in Fig. <a href="#fig27" title="go to Fig. 27">27</a> is drawn from
these determinations; and it will be seen that, while it is by no means
exact at the lower temperatures, and will of course fail us altogether
at very high <span class="xxpn" id="p113">{113}</span> temperatures,
yet it serves as a very satisfactory guide to the relations between
rate and temperature within the ordinary limits of healthy growth. Miss
Leitch holds that the curve is <i>not</i> a van’t Hoff curve; and this, in
strict accuracy, we need not dispute. But the phenomenon seems to me to
be one into which the van’t Hoff ratio enters largely, though doubtless
combined with other factors which we cannot at present determine or
eliminate.</p>

 data.)</div></div>

<p>While the above results conform fairly well to the law of
the temperature coefficient, it is evident that the imbibition
of water plays so large a part in the process of elongation
of the root or stem that the phenomenon is rather a physical
than a chemical one: and on this account, as Blackman has
remarked, the data commonly given for the rate of growth in
plants are apt to be <span class="xxpn" id="p114">{114}</span>
irregular, and sometimes (we might even say) misleading<a
class="afnanch" href="#fn144" id="fnanch144">144</a>. The
fact also, which we have already learned, that the elongation
of a shoot tends to proceed by jerks, rather than smoothly,
is another indication that the phenomenon is not purely
and simply a chemical one. We have abundant illustrations,
however, among animals, in which we may study the temperature
coefficient under circumstances where, though the phenomenon
is always complicated by osmotic factors, true metabolic
growth or chemical combination plays a larger role. Thus Mlle.
Maltaux and Professor Massart<a class="afnanch" href="#fn145"
id="fnanch145">145</a> have studied the rate of division in
a certain flagellate, <i>Chilomonas paramoecium</i>, and found
the process to take 29 minutes at 15° C., 12 at 25°, and
only 5 minutes at 35° C. These velocities are in the ratio
of 1&#x202f;:&#x202f;2·4&#x202f;:&#x202f;5·76, which ratio
corresponds precisely to a temperature coefficient of 2·4 for
each rise of 10°, or about 1·092 for each degree centigrade.</p>

<p>By means of this principle we may throw light on the apparently
complicated results of many experiments. For instance, Fig. <a href="#fig28" title="go to Fig. 28">28</a>
is an illustration, which has been often copied, of O. Hertwig’s
work on the effect of temperature on the rate of development of
the tadpole<a class="afnanch" href="#fn146" id="fnanch146">146</a>.</p>

<p>From inspection of this diagram, we see that the time taken
to attain certain stages of development (denoted by the numbers
III–VII) was as follows, at 20° and at 10° C., respectively.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the temperature coefficient varies with the
temperature, diminishing as the temperature rises,—a rule which
van’t Hoff has shewn to hold in ordinary chemical operations.
Thus, in Rana the temperature coefficient at low temperatures
may be as high as 5·6: which is just another way of saying that
at low temperatures development is exceptionally retarded.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>In certain fish, such as plaice and haddock, I and others have
found clear evidence that the ascending curve of growth is subject
to seasonal interruptions, the rate during the winter months
being always slower than in the months of summer: it is as though
we superimposed a periodic, annual, sine-curve upon the continuous
curve of growth. And further, as growth itself grows less and less
from year to year, so will the difference between the winter and
the summer rate also grow less and less.
The fluctuation in rate <span class="xxpn" id="p118">{118}</span>
will represent a vibration which is gradually dying out; the amplitude
of the sine-curve will gradually diminish till it disappears;
in short, our phenomenon is simply expressed by what is known
as a “damped sine-curve.” Exactly the same thing occurs in
man, though neither in his case nor in that of the fish have we
sufficient data for its complete illustration.</p>

<p>We can demonstrate the fact, however, in the case of man by the help
of certain very interesting measurements which have been recorded by
Daffner<a class="afnanch" href="#fn148" id="fnanch148">148</a>,

they form two even and entirely separate series. The curve

<p>The measurements taken were those of the girth of the tree,
in mm., at three feet from the ground. The evergreens included
species of Pinus, Eucalyptus and Acacia; the deciduous trees
included Quercus, Populus, Robinia and Melia. I have merely
taken mean values for these two groups, and expressed the
monthly values as percentages of the mean annual increase. The
result (as shewn by Fig. <a href="#fig31" title="go to Fig. 31">31</a>) is very much what we might have
expected. The growth of the deciduous trees is completely
arrested in winter-time, and the arrest is
all but complete over <span class="xxpn" id="p120">{120}</span>
a considerable period of time; moreover, during the warm season,
the monthly values are regularly graded (ap­prox­i­mate­ly in a
sine-curve) with a clear maximum (in the southern hemisphere)
about the month of December. In the evergreen trees, on the
other hand, the amplitude of the periodic wave is very much
less; there is a notable amount of growth all the year round,
and, while there is a marked diminution in rate during the coldest
months, there is a tendency towards equality over a considerable
part of the warmer season. It is probable that some of the
species examined, and especially the pines, were definitely retarded
in growth, either by a temperature above their optimum, or by
deficiency of moisture, during the hottest period of the year;
with the result that the seasonal curve in our diagram has (as it
were) its region of maximum cut off.</p>

 <div class="pcaption">Fig. 31. Periodic annual fluctuation in rate
of growth of trees (in the southern hemisphere).</div></div>

<p>In the case of trees, the seasonal periodicity of growth is so well
marked that we are entitled to make use of the phenomenon in a converse
way, and to draw deductions as to variations in <span class="xxpn"
id="p121">{121}</span> climate during past years from the record of
varying rates of growth which the tree, by the thickness of its annual
rings, has preserved for us. Mr. A. E. Douglass, of the University of
Arizona, has made a careful study of this question<a class="afnanch"
href="#fn151" id="fnanch151">151</a>,
and I have received (through
Professor H. H. Turner of Oxford) some measurements of the average
width of the successive annual rings in “yellow pine,” 500 years
old, from Arizona, in which trees the annual rings are very clearly
distinguished. From the year 1391 to 1518, the mean of two trees was
used; from 1519 to 1912, the mean of five; and the means of these,
and sometimes of larger numbers, were found to be very concordant. A
correction was applied by drawing a long, nearly straight line through
the curve for the whole period, which line was assumed to represent
the slowly diminishing mean width of ring accompanying the increase
of size, or age, of the tree; and the actual growth as measured was
equated with this diminishing mean. The figures used give, accordingly,
the ratio of the actual growth in each year to the mean growth
cor­re­spon­ding to the age or magnitude of the tree at that epoch.</p>

<p>It was at once manifest that the rate of growth so determined
shewed a tendency to fluctuate in a long period of between 100 and
200 years. I then smoothed in groups of 100 (according to Gauss’s
method) the yearly values, so that each number thus found
represented the mean annual increase during a century: that is
to say, the value ascribed to the year 1500 represented the <i>average
annual growth</i> during the whole period between 1450 and 1550,
and so on. These values give us a curve of beautiful and surprising
smoothness, from which we seem compelled to draw the direct
conclusion that the climate of Arizona, during the last 500 years,
has fluctuated with a regular periodicity of almost precisely 150
years. Here again we should be left in doubt
(so far as these <span class="xxpn" id="p123">{123}</span>
observations go) whether the essential factor be a fluctuation of
temperature or an alternation of moisture and aridity; but the
character of the Arizona climate, and the known facts of recent
years, encourage the belief that the latter is the more direct and
more important factor.</p>

<p>It has been often remarked that our common European trees, such
for instance as the elm or the cherry, tend to have larger leaves the
further north we go; but in this case the phenomenon is to be ascribed
rather to the longer hours of daylight than to any difference of
temperature<a class="afnanch" href="#fn152" id="fnanch152">152</a>.
The
point is a physiological one, and consequently of little importance to
us here<a class="afnanch" href="#fn153" id="fnanch153">153</a>;
the
main point for the morphologist is the very simple one that physical
or climatic conditions have greatly influenced the rate of growth. The
case is analogous to the direct influence of temperature in modifying
the colouration of organisms, such as certain butterflies. Now if
temperature affects the rate of growth in strict uniformity, alike
in all directions and in all parts or organs, its direct effect must
be limited to the production of local races or varieties differing
from one another in actual magnitude, as the Siberian goldfinch or
bullfinch, for instance, differ from our own. But if there be even ever
so little of a discriminating action in the enhancement of growth by
temperature, such that it accelerates the growth of one tissue or one
organ more than another, then it is evident that it must at once lead
to an actual difference of racial, or even “specific” form.</p>

<p>It is not to be doubted that the various factors of climate
have some such discriminating influence. The leaves of our
northern trees may themselves be an instance of it;
and we have, <span class="xxpn" id="p124">{124}</span>
probably, a still better instance of it in the case of Alpine
plants<a class="afnanch" href="#fn154" id="fnanch154">154</a>,
whose general habit is dwarfed, though their floral organs suffer
little or no reduction. The subject, however, has been little
investigated, and great as its theoretic importance would be to
us, we must meanwhile leave it alone.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3><i>Osmotic factors in growth.</i></h3></div>

<p>The curves of growth which we have now been studying
represent phenomena which have at least a two-fold interest,
morphological and physiological. To the morphologist, who
recognises that form is a “function” of growth, the important
facts are mainly these: (1) that the rate of growth is an orderly
phenomenon, with general features common to very various
organisms, while each particular organism has its own char­ac­ter­is­tic
phenomena, or “specific constants”; (2) that rate of growth
varies with temperature, that is to say with season and with
climate, and with various other physical factors, external and
internal; (3) that it varies in different parts of the body, and
according to various directions or axes; such variations being
definitely correlated with one another, and thus giving rise to
the char­ac­ter­is­tic proportions, or form, of the organism, and to
the changes in form which it undergoes in the course of its
development. But to the physiologist, the phenomenon suggests
many other important con­si­de­ra­tions, and throws much light on
the very nature of growth itself, as a manifestation of chemical
and physical energies.</p>

<p>To be content to shew that a certain rate of growth occurs in
a certain organism under certain conditions, or to speak of the
phenomenon as a “reaction” of the living organism to its environment
or to certain stimuli, would be but an example of that “lack
of particularity<a class="afnanch" href="#fn155" id="fnanch155">155</a>”
in regard to the actual mechanism of physical
cause and effect with which we are apt in biology to be too easily
satisfied. But in the case of rate of
growth we pass somewhat <span class="xxpn" id="p125">{125}</span>
beyond these limitations; for the affinity with certain types of
chemical reaction is plain, and has been recognised by a great
number of physiologists.</p>

<p>A large part of the phenomenon of growth, both in animals
and still more conspicuously in plants, is associated with “turgor,”
that is to say, is dependent on osmotic conditions; in other words,
the velocity of growth depends in great measure (as we have already
seen, p. <a href="#p113" title="go to pg. 113">113</a>)
on the amount of water taken up into the living
cells, as well as on the actual amount of chemical metabolism
performed by them<a class="afnanch" href="#fn156" id="fnanch156">156</a>.
Of the chemical phenomena which result
in the actual increase of protoplasm we shall speak presently, but
the rôle of water in growth deserves also a passing word, even in
our morphological enquiry.</p>

<p>It has been shewn by Loeb that in Cerianthus or Tubularia,
for instance, the cells in order to grow must be turgescent; and
this turgescence is only possible so long as the salt water in which
the cells lie does not overstep a certain limit of concentration. The
limit, in the case of Tubularia, is passed when the salt amounts
to about 5·4 per cent. Sea-water contains some 3·0 to 3·5 p.c.
of salts; but it is when the salinity falls much below this normal,
to about 2·2 p.c., that Tubularia exhibits its maximal turgescence,
and maximal growth. A further dilution is said to act as a poison
to the animal. Loeb has also shewn<a class="afnanch" href="#fn157" id="fnanch157">157</a>
that in certain eggs (e.g.
those of the little fish <i>Fundulus</i>) an increasing concentration of
the sea-water (leading to a diminishing “water-content” of the
egg) retards the rate of segmentation and at length renders
segmentation impossible; though nuclear division, by the way,
goes on for some time longer.</p>

<p>Among many other observations of the same kind, those of
Bialaszewicz<a class="afnanch" href="#fn158" id="fnanch158">158</a>,
on the early growth of the frog, are notable.
He shews that the growth of the embryo while
still <i>within the <span class="xxpn" id="p126">{126}</span>
vitelline membrane</i> depends wholly on the absorption of water;
that whether rate of growth be fast or slow (in accordance with
temperature) the quantity of water absorbed is constant; and
that successive changes of form correspond to definite quantities
of water absorbed. The solid residue, as Davenport has also
shewn, may actually and notably diminish, while the embryo
organism is increasing rapidly in bulk and weight.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in later stages and especially in the higher
animals, the percentage of water tends to diminish. This has
been shewn by Davenport in the frog, by Potts in the chick, and
particularly by Fehling in the case of man<a class="afnanch" href="#fn159" id="fnanch159">159</a>.
Fehling’s results
are epitomised as follows:</p>

<p>To such phenomena of osmotic balance as the above, or in other
words to the dependence of growth on the uptake of water, Höber<a class="afnanch" href="#fn160" id="fnanch160">160</a>
and also Loeb are inclined to refer the modifications of form
which certain phyllopod crustacea undergo, when the highly
saline waters which they inhabit are further concentrated, or are
abnormally diluted. Their growth, according to Schmankewitsch,
is retarded by increase of concentration, so that the individuals
from the more saline waters appear stunted and dwarfish; and
they become altered or transformed in other ways, which for the
most part suggest “degeneration,” or a failure to attain full and
perfect development<a class="afnanch" href="#fn161" id="fnanch161">161</a>.
Important physiological changes also
ensue. The rate of multiplication is increased, and parthenogenetic
reproduction is encouraged. Male individuals become
plentiful in the less saline waters, and here the
females bring forth <span class="xxpn" id="p127">{127}</span>
their young alive; males disappear altogether in the more concentrated
brines, and then the females lay eggs, which, however,
only begin to develop when the salinity is somewhat reduced.</p>

<p>The best-known case is the little “brine-shrimp,” <i>Artemia
salina</i>, found, in one form or another, all the world over, and first
discovered more than a century and a half ago in the salt-pans at
Lymington. Among many allied forms, one, <i>A. milhausenii</i>,
inhabits the natron-lakes of Egypt and Arabia, where, under the
name of “loul,” or “Fezzan-worm,” it is eaten by the Arabs<a class="afnanch" href="#fn162" id="fnanch162">162</a>.
This fact is interesting, because it indicates (and in­ves­ti­ga­tion
has apparently confirmed) that the tissues of the creature are not
impregnated with salt, as is the medium in which it lives. The
fluids of the body, the <i>milieu interne</i> (as Claude Bernard called
them<a class="afnanch" href="#fn163" id="fnanch163">163</a>),
are no more salt than are those of any ordinary crustacean
or other animal, but contain only some 0·8 per cent. of
NaCl<a class="afnanch" href="#fn164" id="fnanch164">164</a>,
while the <i>milieu externe</i> may contain 10, 20, or more per
cent. of this and other salts; which is as much as to say that
the skin, or body-wall, of the creature acts as a “semi-permeable
membrane,” through which the dissolved salts are not permitted
to diffuse, though water passes through freely: until a statical
equi­lib­rium (doubtless of a complex kind) is at length attained.</p>

<p>Among the structural changes which result from increased
concentration of the brine (partly during the life-time of the
individual, but more markedly during the short season which
suffices for the development of three or four, or perhaps more,
successive generations), it is found that the tail comes to bear
fewer and fewer bristles, and the tail-fins themselves tend at last
to disappear; these changes cor­re­spon­ding to
what have been <span class="xxpn" id="p128">{128}</span>
described as the specific characters of <i>A. milhausenii</i>, and of a
still more extreme form, <i>A. köppeniana</i>; while on the other
hand, progressive dilution of the water tends to precisely opposite
conditions, resulting in forms which have also been described as
separate species, and even referred to a separate genus, Callaonella,
closely akin to Branchipus (Fig. <a href="#fig33" title="go to Fig. 33">33</a>). <i>Pari passu</i> with these changes,
there is a marked change in the relative lengths of the fore and
hind portions of the body, that is to say, of the “cephalothorax”
and abdomen: the latter growing relatively longer, the salter the
water. In other words, not only is the rate of growth of the whole</p>

<div class="dctr02" id="fig33">

 <div class="pcaption">Fig. 33. Brine-shrimps (Artemia), from more

<p class="pcontinue">animal lessened by the saline concentration, but the specific rates
of growth in the parts of its body are relatively changed. This
latter phenomenon lends itself to numerical statement, and Abonyi
has lately shewn that we may construct a very regular curve, by
plotting the proportionate length of the creature’s abdomen
against the salinity, or density, of the water; and the several
species of Artemia, with all their other correlated specific characters,
are then found to occupy successive, more or less well-defined, and
more or less extended, regions of the curve (Fig. <a href="#fig33" title="go to Fig. 33">33</a>). In short, the
density of the water is so clearly a “function”
of the specific <span class="xxpn" id="p129">{129}</span>
character, that we may briefly define the species <i>Artemia</i> (<i>Callaonella</i>)
<i>Jelskii</i>, for instance, as the Artemia of density 1000–1010
(NaCl), or the typical <i>A. salina</i>, or <i>principalis</i>, as the Artemia
of density 1018–1025, and so forth. It is a most interesting
fact that these Artemiae, under the protection of their semi-permeable
skins, are capable of living in waters not only of
great density, but of very varied chemical composition. The
natron-lakes, for instance, contain large quantities of magnesium</p>

<div class="dctr01" id="fig34">
<img src="images/i129.png" width="800" height="645" alt="" />
 <div class="pcaption">Fig. 34. Percentage ratio of length of
 abdomen to cephalothorax in brine-shrimps, at various
 salinities. (After Abonyi.)</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">sulphate; and the Artemiae continue to live equally well in
artificial solutions where this salt, or where calcium chloride, has
largely taken the place of sodium chloride in the more common
habitat. Furthermore, such waters as those of the natron-lakes
are subject to very great changes of chemical composition as
concentration proceeds, owing to the different solubilities of the
constituent salts. It appears that the forms which the Artemiae
assume, and the changes which they undergo,
are identical or <span class="xxpn" id="p130">{130}</span>
in­dis­tin­guish­able, whichever of the above salts happen to exist,
or to predominate, in their saline habitat. At the same time we
still lack (so far as I know) the simple, but crucial experiments
which shall tell us whether, in solutions of different chemical
composition, it is <i>at equal densities</i>, or at “<i>isotonic</i>” concentrations
(that is to say, under conditions where the osmotic pressure,
and consequently the rate of diffusion, is identical), that the
same structural changes are produced, or cor­re­spon­ding phases
of equi­lib­rium attained.</p>

<p>While Höber and others<a class="afnanch" href="#fn165" id="fnanch165">165</a>
have referred all these phenomena to
osmosis, Abonyi is inclined to believe that the viscosity, or
mechanical resistance, of the fluid also reacts upon the organism;
and other possible modes of operation have been suggested.
But we may take it for certain that the phenomenon as a whole
is not a simple one; and that it includes besides the passive
phenomena of intermolecular diffusion, some other form of activity
which plays the part of a regulatory mechanism<a class="afnanch" href="#fn166" id="fnanch166">166</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3><i>Growth and catalytic action.</i></h3></div>

<p>In ordinary chemical reactions we have to deal (1) with a
specific velocity proper to the particular reaction, (2) with variations
due to temperature and other physical conditions, (3) according
to van’t Hoff’s “Law of Mass,” with variations due to the actual
quantities present of the reacting substances, and (4) in certain
cases, with variations due to the presence of “catalysing agents.”
In the simpler reactions, the law of mass involves a steady, gradual
slowing-down of the process, according to a logarithmic ratio, as
the reaction proceeds and as the initial amount of substance
diminishes; a phenomenon, however, which
need not necessarily <span class="xxpn" id="p131">{131}</span>
occur in the organism, part of whose energies are devoted to the
continual bringing-up of fresh supplies.</p>

<p>Catalytic action occurs when some substance, often in very
minute quantity, is present, and by its presence produces or
accelerates an action, by opening “a way round,” without
the catalytic agent itself being diminished or used up<a class="afnanch" href="#fn167" id="fnanch167">167</a>.
Here the velocity curve, though quickened, is not necessarily
altered in form, for gradually the law of mass exerts its
effect and the rate of the reaction gradually diminishes. But
in certain cases we have the very remarkable phenomenon that
a body acting as a catalyser is necessarily formed as a product,
or bye-product, of the main reaction, and in such a case as this
the reaction-velocity will tend to be steadily accelerated. Instead
of dwindling away, the reaction will continue with an ever-increasing
velocity: always subject to the reservation that limiting
conditions will in time make themselves felt, such as a failure of
some necessary ingredient, or a development of some substance
which shall antagonise or finally destroy the original reaction.
Such an action as this we have learned, from Ostwald, to describe
as “autocatalysis.” Now we know that certain products of
protoplasmic metabolism, such as the enzymes, are very powerful
catalysers, and we are entitled to speak of an autocatalytic action
on the part of protoplasm itself. This catalytic activity of protoplasm
is a very important phenomenon. As Blackman says,
in the address already quoted, the botanists (or the zoologists)
“call it <i>growth</i>, attribute it to a specific power of protoplasm for
assimilation, and leave it alone as a fundamental phenomenon;
but they are much concerned as to the distribution of new growth
in innumerable specifically distinct forms.” While the chemist, on
the other hand, recognises it as a familiar phenomenon, and refers it
to the same category as his other known examples
of <i>autocatalysis</i>. <span class="xxpn" id="p132">{132}</span></p>

<p>This very important, and perhaps even fundamental phenomenon
of growth would seem to have been first recognised by
Professor Chodat of Geneva, as we are told by his pupil Monnier<a class="afnanch" href="#fn168" id="fnanch168">168</a>.
“On peut bien, ainsi que M. Chodat l’a proposé, considérer
l’accroissement comme une réaction chimique complexe, dans
laquelle le catalysateur est la cellule vivante, et les corps en
présence sont l’eau, les sels, et l’acide carbonique.”</p>

<p>Very soon afterwards a similar suggestion was made by Loeb<a class="afnanch" href="#fn169" id="fnanch169">169</a>,
in connection with the synthesis of <i>nuclein</i> or nuclear protoplasm;
for he remarked that, as in an autocatalysed chemical reaction,
the velocity of the synthesis increases during the initial stage of
cell-division in proportion to the amount of nuclear matter already
synthesised. In other words, one of the products of the reaction,
i.e. one of the constituents of the nucleus, accelerates the production
of nuclear from cytoplasmic material.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of autocatalysis is by no means confined to
living or protoplasmic chemistry, but at the same time it is
char­ac­teris­ti­cally, and apparently constantly, associated therewith.
And it would seem that to it we may ascribe a considerable part
of the difference between the growth of the organism and the
simpler growth of the crystal<a class="afnanch" href="#fn170" id="fnanch170">170</a>:
the fact, for instance, that the cell
can grow in a very low concentration of its nutritive solution,
while the crystal grows only in a supersaturated one; and the
fundamental fact that the nutritive solution need only contain
the more or less raw materials of the complex constituents of the
cell, while the crystal grows only in a solution of its own actual
substance<a class="afnanch" href="#fn171" id="fnanch171">171</a>.</p>

<p>As F. F. Blackman has pointed out, the multiplication of an
organism, for instance the prodigiously rapid
increase of a bacterium, <span class="xxpn" id="p133">{133}</span>
which tends to double its numbers every few minutes, till (were
it not for limiting factors) its numbers would be all but incalculable
in a day<a class="afnanch" href="#fn172" id="fnanch172">172</a>,
is a simple but most striking illustration of the potentialities
of protoplasmic catalysis; and (apart from the large share
taken by mere “turgescence” or imbibition of water) the same
is true of the growth, or cell-multiplication, of a multicellular
organism in its first stage of rapid acceleration.</p>

<p>It is not necessary for us to pursue this subject much further,
for it is sufficiently clear that the normal “curve of growth” of
an organism, in all its general features, very closely resembles the
velocity-curve of chemical autocatalysis. We see in it the first
and most typical phase of greater and greater acceleration; this
is followed by a phase in which limiting conditions (whose details
are practically unknown) lead to a falling off of the former
acceleration; and in most cases we come at length to a third phase,
in which retardation of growth is succeeded by actual diminution
of mass. Here we may recognise the influence of processes, or
of products, which have become actually deleterious; their
deleterious influence is staved off for a while, as the organism draws
on its accumulated reserves, but they lead ere long to the stoppage
of all activity, and to the physical phenomenon of death. But
when we have once admitted that the limiting conditions of
growth, which cause a phase of retardation to follow a phase
of acceleration, are very imperfectly known, it is plain that,
<i>ipso facto</i>, we must admit that a resemblance rather than an
identity between this phenomenon and that of chemical autocatalysis
is all that we can safely assert meanwhile. Indeed, as
Enriques has shewn, points of contrast between the two phenomena
are not lacking; for instance, as the chemical reaction draws to
a close, it is by the gradual attainment of chemical equi­lib­rium:
but when organic growth draws to a close, it is by reason of a very
different kind of equi­lib­rium, due in the main to the gradual
differentiation of the organism into parts,
among whose peculiar <span class="xxpn" id="p134">{134}</span>
and specialised functions that of cell-multiplication tends to fall
into abeyance<a class="afnanch" href="#fn173" id="fnanch173">173</a>.</p>

<p>It would seem to follow, as a natural consequence, from what
has been said, that we could without much difficulty reduce our
curves of growth to logarithmic formulae<a class="afnanch" href="#fn174" id="fnanch174">174</a>
akin to those which
the physical chemist finds applicable to his autocatalytic reactions.
This has been diligently attempted by various writers<a class="afnanch" href="#fn175" id="fnanch175">175</a>;
but the
results, while not destructive of the hypothesis itself, are only
partially successful. The difficulty arises mainly from the fact
that, in the life-history of an organism, we have usually to deal
(as indeed we have seen) with several recurrent periods of relative
acceleration and retardation. It is easy to find a formula which
shall satisfy the conditions during any one of these periodic
phases, but it is very difficult to frame a comprehensive formula
which shall apply to the entire period of growth, or to the whole
duration of life.</p>

<p>But if it be meanwhile impossible to formulate or to solve in
precise math­e­mat­i­cal terms the equation to the growth of an
organism, we have yet gone a very long way towards the solution
of such problems when we have found a “qualitative expression,”
as Poincaré puts it; that is to say, when we have gained a fair
ap­prox­i­mate knowledge of the general curve which represents the
unknown function.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>As soon as we have touched on such matters as the chemical
phenomenon of catalysis, we are on the threshold of a subject
which, if we were able to pursue it, would soon lead us far into
the special domain of physiology; and there it would be necessary
to follow it if we were dealing with growth as a phenomenon in
itself, instead of merely as a help to our study and comprehension
of form. For instance the whole question of <i>diet</i>, of overfeeding
and underfeeding, would present itself for discussion<a class="afnanch" href="#fn176" id="fnanch176">176</a>.
But
without attempting to open up this large
subject, we may say a <span class="xxpn" id="p135">{135}</span>
further passing word upon the essential fact that certain chemical
substances have the power of accelerating or of retarding, or in
some way regulating, growth, and of so influencing directly the
morphological features of the organism.</p>

<p>Thus lecithin has been shewn by Hatai<a class="afnanch" href="#fn177" id="fnanch177">177</a>,
Danilewsky<a class="afnanch" href="#fn178" id="fnanch178">178</a>
and
others to have a remarkable power of stimulating growth in
various animals; and the so-called “auximones,” which Professor
Bottomley prepares by the action of bacteria upon peat appear
to be, after a somewhat similar fashion, potent accelerators of
the growth of plants. But by much the most interesting cases,
from our point of view, are those where a particular substance
appears to exert a differential effect, stimulating the growth of
one part or organ of the body more than another.</p>

<p>It has been known for a number of years that a diseased
condition of the pituitary body accompanies the phenomenon
known as “acromegaly,” in which the bones are variously enlarged
or elongated, and which is more or less exemplified in every
skeleton of a “giant”; while on the other hand, disease or extirpation
of the thyroid causes an arrest of skeletal development, and,
if it take place early, the subject remains a dwarf. These, then,
are well-known illustrations of the regulation of function by some
internal glandular secretion, some enzyme or “hormone” (as
Bayliss and Starling call it), or “harmozone,” as Gley calls it in
the particular case where the function regulated is that of growth,
with its consequent influence on form.</p>

<p>Among other illustrations (which are plentiful) we have, for
instance the growth of the placental decidua, which Loeb has
shewn to be due to a substance given off by the corpus luteum
of the ovary, giving to the uterine tissues an abnormal capacity
for growth, which in turn is called into action by the contact of
the ovum, or even of any foreign body. And various sexual
characters, such as the plumage, comb and spurs of the cock,
are believed in like manner to arise in response to some particular
internal secretion. When the source of such a secretion is removed
by castration, well-known morphological changes take place in
various animals; and when a converse change takes place, the
female acquires, in greater or less degree,
characters which are <span class="xxpn" id="p136">{136}</span>
proper to the male, as in certain extreme cases, known from time
immemorial, when late in life a hen assumes the plumage of the
cock.</p>

<p>There are some very remarkable experiments by Gudernatsch,
in which he has shewn that by feeding tadpoles (whether of frogs
or toads) on thyroid gland substance, their legs may be made to
grow out at any time, days or weeks before the normal date of
their appearance<a class="afnanch" href="#fn179" id="fnanch179">179</a>.
No other organic food was found to produce
the same effect; but since the thyroid gland is known to contain
iodine<a class="afnanch" href="#fn180" id="fnanch180">180</a>,
Morse experimented with this latter substance, and found
that if the tadpoles were fed with iodised amino-acids the legs
developed precociously, just as when the thyroid gland itself was
used. We may take it, then, as an established fact, whose full
extent and bearings are still awaiting in­ves­ti­ga­tion, that there
exist substances both within and without the organism which
have a marvellous power of accelerating growth, and of doing so
in such a way as to affect not only the size but the form or proportions
of the organism.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>If we once admit, as we are now bound to do, the existence
of such factors as these, which, by their physiological activity
and apart from any direct action of the nervous system, tend
towards the acceleration of growth and consequent modification
of form, we are led into wide fields of speculation by an easy and
a legitimate pathway. Professor Gley carries such speculations
a long, long way: for he says<a class="afnanch" href="#fn181" id="fnanch181">181</a>
that by these chemical influences
“Toute une partie de la construction des êtres parait s’expliquer
d’une façon toute mécanique. La forteresse, si longtemps inaccessible,
du vitalisme est entamée. Car la notion morphogénique
était, suivant le mot de Dastre<a class="afnanch" href="#fn182" id="fnanch182">182</a>,
comme ‘le dernier réduit de la
force vitale.’&#x200a;”</p>

<p>The physiological speculations we need not discuss: but, to
take a single example from morphology, we begin to understand
the possibility, and to comprehend the probable
meaning, of the <span class="xxpn" id="p137">{137}</span>
all but sudden appearance on the earth of such exaggerated and
almost monstrous forms as those of the great secondary reptiles
and the great tertiary mammals<a class="afnanch" href="#fn183" id="fnanch183">183</a>.
We begin to see that it is in
order to account, not for the appearance, but for the disappearance
of such forms as these that natural selection must be invoked.
And we then, I think, draw near to the conclusion that what is
true of these is universally true, and that the great function of
natural selection is not to originate, but to remove: <i>donec ad
interitum genus id natura redegit</i><a class="afnanch" href="#fn184" id="fnanch184">184</a>.</p>

<p>The world of things living, like the world of things inanimate,
grows of itself, and pursues its ceaseless course of creative evolution.
It has room, wide but not unbounded, for variety of living form
and structure, as these tend towards their seemingly endless, but
yet strictly limited, possibilities of permutation and degree: it
has room for the great and for the small, room for the weak and
for the strong. Environment and circumstance do not always
make a prison, wherein perforce the organism must either live
or die; for the ways of life may be changed, and many a refuge
found, before the sentence of unfitness is pronounced and the
penalty of extermination paid. But there comes a time when
“variation,” in form, dimensions, or other qualities of the organism,
goes farther than is compatible with all the means at hand of
health and welfare for the individual and the stock; when, under
the active and creative stimulus of forces from within and from
without, the active and creative energies of growth pass the
bounds of physical and physiological equi­lib­rium: and so reach
the limits which, as again Lucretius tells us, natural law has set
between what may and what may not be,</p>

<p class="pcontinue">Then, at last, we are entitled to use the customary metaphor,
and to see in natural selection an inexorable force,
whose function <span class="xxpn" id="p138">{138}</span>
is not to create but to destroy,—to weed, to prune, to cut down
and to cast into the fire<a class="afnanch" href="#fn185" id="fnanch185">185</a>.</p>

<h3><i>Regeneration, or growth and repair.</i></h3></div>

<p>The phenomenon of regeneration, or the restoration of lost or
amputated parts, is a particular case of growth which deserves
separate consideration. As we are all aware, this property is
manifested in a high degree among invertebrates and many cold-blooded
vertebrates, diminishing as we ascend the scale, until at
length, in the warm-blooded animals, it lessens down to no more
than that <i>vis medicatrix</i> which heals a wound. Ever since the
days of Aristotle, and especially since the experiments of Trembley,
Réaumur and Spallanzani in the middle of the eighteenth century,
the physiologist and the psychologist have alike recognised that
the phenomenon is both perplexing and important. The general
phenomenon is amply discussed elsewhere, and we need only
deal with it in its immediate relation to growth<a class="afnanch" href="#fn186" id="fnanch186">186</a>.</p>

<p>Regeneration, like growth in other cases, proceeds with a
velocity which varies according to a definite law; the rate varies
with the time, and we may study it as velocity and as acceleration.</p>

<p>Let us take, as an instance, Miss M. L. Durbin’s measurements
of the rate of regeneration of tadpoles’ tails: the rate being here
measured in terms, not of mass, but of length, or longitudinal
increment<a class="afnanch" href="#fn187" id="fnanch187">187</a>.</p>

<p>From a number of tadpoles, whose average length was 34·2 mm.,
their tails being on an average 21·2 mm. long,
about half the tail <span class="xxpn" id="p139">{139}</span>
(11·5 mm.) was cut off, and the amounts regenerated in successive
periods are shewn as follows:</p>

<p>The first line of numbers in this table, if plotted as a curve
against the number of days, will give us a very satisfactory view
of the “curve of growth” within the period of the observations:
that is to say, of the successive relations of length to time, or the
<i>velocity</i> of the process. But the third line is not so satisfactory,
and must not be plotted directly as an acceleration curve. For
it is evident that the “rates” here determined do not correspond
to velocities <i>at</i> the dates to which they are referred, but are the
mean velocities over a preceding period; and moreover the periods
over which these means are taken are here of very unequal length.
But we may draw a good deal more information from this experiment,
if we begin by drawing a smooth curve, as nearly as possible
through the points cor­re­spon­ding to the amounts regenerated
(according to the first line of the table); and if we then interpolate
from this smooth curve the actual lengths attained, day by
day, and derive from these, by subtraction, the successive daily
increments, which are the measure of the daily mean <i>velocities</i>
(Table, p. <a href="#p141" title="go to pg. 141">141</a>). (The more accurate and strictly correct method
would be to draw successive tangents to the curve.)</p>

<p>In our curve of growth (Fig. <a href="#fig35" title="go to Fig. 35">35</a>) we cannot safely interpolate
values for the first three days, that is to say for the dates between
amputation and the first actual measurement of the regenerated
part. What goes on in these three days is very important; but
we know nothing about it, save that our curve descended to zero
somewhere or other within that period. As we have already
learned, we can more or less safely interpolate between known
points, or actual observations; but here we have no known
starting-point. In short, for all that the observations tell us,
and for all that the appearance of the curve can suggest, the
curve of growth may have descended evenly to the base-line,
which it would then have reached about the end
of the second <span class="xxpn" id="p140">{140}</span>
day; or it may have had within the first three days a change of
direction, or “point of inflection,” and may then have sprung
at once from the base-line at zero. That is to say, there may</p>

<p class="pcontinue">or, for all we yet know,
regeneration may have begun at once, but with a velocity much less than
that which it afterwards attained. This apparently trifling difference
would correspond to a very great difference in the nature of the
phenomenon, and would lead to a very striking difference in the curve
which we have next to draw.</p>

<p>The curve already drawn (Fig. <a href="#fig35" title="go to Fig. 35">35</a>) illustrates, as we have seen, the
relation of length to time, i.e. <i>L&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;T</i>
=&#x202f;<i>V</i>. The second (Fig.

(as we have learned) the <i>acceleration</i> of growth, this being simply
the “differential coefficient,” the first derivative of the former
curve.</p>

 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 37. Logarithms

 <a href="#fig36" title="go to Fig. 36">36</a>.</div></div>

<p>Now, plotting this acceleration curve from the date of the
first measurement made three days after the amputation of the
tail (Fig. <a href="#fig36" title="go to Fig. 36">36</a>), we see that it has no point of inflection, but falls
steadily, only more and more slowly, till at last it comes down
nearly to the base-line. The velocities of growth are continually
diminishing. As regards the missing portion at the beginning of
the curve, we cannot be sure whether it bent round and came down
to zero, or whether, as in our ordinary acceleration curves of growth
from birth onwards, it started from a maximum. The former is,
in this case, obviously the more probable, but we cannot be sure.</p>

<p>As regards that large portion of the curve which we are
acquainted with, we see that it resembles the curve known as
a rectangular hyperbola, which is the form assumed when two
variables (in this case <i>V</i> and <i>T</i>) vary inversely as one another.
If we take the logarithms of the velocities (as given in the table)
and plot them against time (Fig. <a href="#fig37" title="go to Fig. 37">37</a>), we see that they fall, ap­prox­i­mate­ly,
into a straight line; and if this curve be
plotted on the <span class="xxpn" id="p143">{143}</span>
proper scale we shall find that the angle which it makes with the
base is about 25°, of which the tangent is ·46, or in round numbers ½.</p>

<p>Had the angle been 45° (tan&#x202f;45°
=&#x202f;1), the
curve would have been actually a rectangular hyperbola,
with <i>V&#x200a;T</i>
=&#x202f;constant. As it is, we may
assume, provisionally, that it belongs to the same family of
curves, so that <span class="nowrap">
<i>V</i>&#xfeff;<sup class="spitc">m</sup>&#x200a;<i>T</i>&#xfeff;<sup
class="spitc">n</sup>&#x202f;,</span> or <span class="nowrap">
<i>V</i>&#xfeff;<sup class="spitc">m&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;n</sup>&#x200a;<i>T</i>,</span> or
<span class="nowrap">
<i>V&#x200a;T</i>&#xfeff;<sup class="spitc">n&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;m</sup>&#x202f;,</span>
are all severally constant. In other
words, the velocity varies inversely as some power of the time,
or <i>vice versa</i>. And in this particular case, the equation
<span class="nowrap"><i>V&#x200a;T</i>&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup></span>
=&#x202f;constant, holds very nearly
true; that is to say the velocity varies, or tends to vary,
inversely as the square of the time. If some general law akin
to this could be established as a general law, or even as a
common rule, it would be of great importance.</p>

 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 38. Rate of regenerative

<p>But though neither in this case nor in any other can the
minute increments of growth during the first few hours, or the
first couple of days, after injury, be directly measured, yet
the most important point is quite capable of solution. What the
foregoing curve leaves us in ignorance of, is simply whether
growth starts at zero, with zero velocity, and works up quickly
to a maximum velocity from which it afterwards gradually
falls away; or whether after a latent period, it begins,
so to speak, in full force. The answer <span class="xxpn"
id="p144">{144}</span> to this question-depends on whether,
in the days following the first actual measurement, we can or
cannot detect a daily <i>increment</i> in velocity, before that
velocity begins its normal course of diminution. Now this
preliminary ascent to a maximum, or point of inflection of
the curve, though not shewn in the above-quoted experiment,
has been often observed: as for instance, in another similar
experiment by the author of the former, the tadpoles being in
this case of larger size (average 49·1 mm.)<a class="afnanch"

<p>The acceleration curve is drawn in Fig. <a href="#fig39" title="go to Fig. 39">39</a>.</p>

<p>Here we have just what we lacked in the former case, namely
a visible point of inflection in the curve about the seventh day
(Figs. <a href="#fig38" title="go to Fig. 38">38</a>, 39), whose existence is confirmed by successive observations
on the 3rd, 5th, 7th and 10th days, and which justifies to
some extent our extrapolation for the otherwise unknown period
up to and ending with the third day; but even here there is a
short space near the very beginning during which we are not
quite sure of the precise slope of the curve.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>We have now learned that, according to these experiments,
with which many others are in substantial agreement, the rate of
growth in the regenerative process is as follows. After a very
short latent period, not yet actually proved but whose existence
is highly probable, growth commences with a
velocity which very <span class="xxpn" id="p145">{145}</span>
rapidly increases to a maximum. The curve quickly,—almost
suddenly,—changes its direction, as the velocity begins to fall;
and the rate of fall, that is, the negative acceleration, proceeds
at a slower and slower rate, which rate varies inversely as some
power of the time, and is found in both of the above-quoted
experiments to be very ap­prox­i­mate­ly as 1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>T</i>&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup>&#x202f;. But it is obvious
that the value which we have found for the latter portion of the
curve (however closely it be conformed to) is only an empirical
value; it has only a temporary usefulness, and must in time give
place to a formula which shall represent the entire phenomenon,
from start to finish.</p>

<p>While the curve of regenerative growth is apparently different
from the curve of ordinary growth as usually drawn (and while
this apparent difference has been commented on and treated as
valid by certain writers) we are now in a position to see that it
only looks different because we are able to study it, if not from
the beginning, at least very nearly so: while an ordinary curve
of growth, as it is usually presented to us, is one
which dates, not <span class="xxpn" id="p146">{146}</span>
from the beginning of growth, but from the comparatively late,
and unimportant, and even fallacious epoch of birth. A complete
curve of growth, starting from zero, has the same essential char­ac­teris­tics
as the regeneration curve.</p>

<p>Indeed the more we consider the phenomenon of regeneration,
the more plainly does it shew itself to us as but a particular case
of the general phenomenon of growth<a class="afnanch" href="#fn189" id="fnanch189">189</a>,
following the same lines,
obeying the same laws, and merely started into activity by the
special stimulus, direct or indirect, caused by the infliction of a
wound. Neither more nor less than in other problems of physiology
are we called upon, in the case of regeneration, to indulge in
metaphysical speculation, or to dwell upon the beneficent purpose
which seemingly underlies this process of healing and restoration.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>It is a very general rule, though apparently not a universal
one, that regeneration tends to fall somewhat short of a <i>complete</i>
restoration of the lost part; a certain percentage only of the lost
tissues is restored. This fact was well known to some of those
old investigators, who, like the Abbé Trembley and like Voltaire,
found a fascination in the study of artificial injury and the regeneration
which followed it. Sir John Graham Dalyell, for instance,
says, in the course of an admirable paragraph on regeneration<a class="afnanch" href="#fn190" id="fnanch190">190</a>:
“The reproductive faculty&#x200a;...&#x200a;is not confined to one portion, but
may extend over many; and it may ensue even in relation to the
regenerated portion more than once. Nevertheless, the faculty
gradually weakens, so that in general every successive regeneration
is smaller and more imperfect than the organisation preceding it;
and at length it is exhausted.”</p>

<p>In certain minute animals, such as the Infusoria, in which the
capacity for “regeneration” is so great that the entire animal
may be restored from the merest fragment, it becomes of great
interest to discover whether there be some definite size at which
the fragment ceases to display this power.
This question has <span class="xxpn" id="p147">{147}</span>
been studied by Lillie<a class="afnanch" href="#fn191" id="fnanch191">191</a>,
who found that in Stentor, while still
smaller fragments were capable of surviving for days, the smallest
portions capable of regeneration were of a size equal to a sphere of
about 80 µ in diameter, that is to say of a volume equal to about
one twenty-seventh of the average entire animal. He arrives at
the remarkable conclusion that for this, and for all other species
of animals, there is a “minimal organisation mass,” that is to say
a “minimal mass of definite size consisting of nucleus and cytoplasm
within which the organisation of the species can just find
its latent expression.” And in like manner, Boveri<a class="afnanch" href="#fn192" id="fnanch192">192</a>
has shewn
that the fragment of a sea-urchin’s egg capable of growing up into
a new embryo, and so discharging the complete functions of an
entire and uninjured ovum, reaches its limit at about one-twentieth
of the original egg,—other writers having found a limit at about
one-fourth. These magnitudes, small as they are, represent
objects easily visible under a low power of the microscope, and so
stand in a very different category to the minimal magnitudes in
which life itself can be manifested, and which we have discussed
in chapter II.</p>

<p>A number of phenomena connected with the linear rate of
regeneration are illustrated and epitomised in the accompanying
diagram (Fig. <a href="#fig40" title="go to Fig. 40">40</a>), which I have constructed from certain data
given by Ellis in a paper on the relation of the amount of tail
<i>regenerated</i> to the amount <i>removed</i>, in Tadpoles. These data are
summarised in the next Table. The tadpoles were all very much
of a size, about 40 mm.; the average length of tail was very near
to 26 mm., or 65 per cent. of the whole body-length; and in four
series of experiments about 10, 20, 40 and 60 per cent. of the tail
were severally removed. The amount regenerated in successive
intervals of three days is shewn in our table. By plotting the
actual amounts regenerated against these three-day intervals of
time, we may interpolate values for the time taken to regenerate
definite percentage amounts, 5 per cent., 10 per
cent., etc. of the <span class="xxpn" id="p148">{148}</span></p>

<p class="pcontinue">amount removed; and my diagram is constructed from the four
sets of values thus obtained, that is to say from the four sets of
experiments which differed from one another in the amount of
tail amputated. To these we have to add the general result of a
fifth series of experiments, which shewed that when as much as
75 per cent. of the tail was cut off, no regeneration took place at
all, but the animal presently died. In our
diagram, then, each <span class="xxpn" id="p149">{149}</span>
curve indicates the time taken to regenerate <i>n</i> per cent. of the
amount removed. All the curves converge towards infinity, when
the amount removed (as shewn by the ordinate) approaches 75
per cent.; and all of the curves start from zero, for nothing is
regenerated where nothing had been removed. Each curve approximates
in form to a cubic parabola.</p>

<p>The amount regenerated varies also with the age of the tadpole
and with other factors, such as temperature; in other words, for
any given age, or size, of tadpole and also for various specific
temperatures, a similar diagram might be constructed.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The power of reproducing, or regenerating, a lost limb is
particularly well developed in arthropod animals, and is sometimes
accompanied by remarkable modification of the form of
the regenerated limb. A case in point, which has attracted
much attention, occurs in connection with the claws of certain
Crustacea<a class="afnanch" href="#fn193" id="fnanch193">193</a>.</p>

<p>In many Crustacea we have an asymmetry of the great claws,
one being larger than the other and also more or less different in
form. For instance, in the common lobster, one claw, the larger
of the two, is provided with a few great “crushing” teeth, while
the smaller claw has more numerous teeth, small and serrated.
Though Aristotle thought otherwise, it appears that the crushing-claw
may be on the right or left side, indifferently; whether it
be on one or the other is a problem of “chance.” It is otherwise
in many other Crustacea, where the larger and more powerful
claw is always left or right, as the case may be, according to the
species: where, in other words, the “probability” of the large
or the small claw being left or being right is tantamount to
certainty<a class="afnanch" href="#fn194" id="fnanch194">194</a>.</p>

<p>The one claw is the larger because it has
grown the faster; <span class="xxpn" id="p150">{150}</span>
it has a higher “coefficient of growth,” and accordingly, as age
advances, the disproportion between the two claws becomes more
and more evident. Moreover, we must assume that the char­ac­ter­is­tic
form of the claw is a “function” of its magnitude; the
knobbiness is a phenomenon coincident with growth, and we
never, under any circumstances, find the smaller claw with big
crushing teeth and the big claw with little serrated ones. There
are many other somewhat similar cases where size and form are
manifestly correlated, and we have already seen, to some extent,
that the phenomenon of growth is accompanied by certain ratios
of velocity that lead inevitably to changes of form. Meanwhile,
then, we must simply assume that the essential difference between
the two claws is one of magnitude, with which a certain differentiation
of form is inseparably associated.</p>

<p>If we amputate a claw, or if, as often happens, the crab “casts
it off,” it undergoes a process of regeneration,—it grows anew,
and evidently does so with an accelerated velocity, which acceleration
will cease when equi­lib­rium of the parts is once more attained:
the accelerated velocity being a case in point to illustrate that
<i>vis revulsionis</i> of Haller, to which we have already referred.</p>

<p>With the help of this principle, Przibram accounts for certain
curious phenomena which accompany the process of regeneration.
As his experiments and those of Morgan shew, if the large or
knobby claw (<i>A</i>) be removed, there are certain cases, e.g. the
common lobster, where it is directly regenerated. In other cases,
e.g. Alpheus<a class="afnanch" href="#fn195" id="fnanch195">195</a>,
the other claw (<i>B</i>) assumes the size and form of that
which was amputated, while the latter regenerates itself in the
form of the other and weaker one; <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> have apparently
changed places. In a third case, as in the crabs, the <i>A</i>-claw regenerates
itself as a small or <i>B</i>-claw, but the <i>B</i>-claw remains for a
time unaltered, though slowly and in the course of repeated moults
it later on assumes the large and heavily toothed <i>A</i>-form.</p>

<p>Much has been written on this phenomenon, but in essence it
is very simple. It depends upon the respective rates of growth,
upon a ratio between the rate of regeneration and the rate of
growth of the uninjured limb: complicated a
little, however, by <span class="xxpn" id="p151">{151}</span>
the possibility of the uninjured limb growing all the faster for
a time after the animal has been relieved of the other. From the
time of amputation, say of <i>A</i>, <i>A</i> begins to grow from zero, with
a high “regenerative” velocity; while <i>B</i>, starting from a definite
magnitude, continues to increase, with its normal or perhaps
somewhat accelerated velocity. The ratio between the two
velocities of growth will determine whether, by a given time,
<i>A</i> has equalled, outstripped, or still fallen short of the magnitude
of <i>B</i>.</p>

<p>That this is the gist of the whole problem is confirmed (if
confirmation be necessary) by certain experiments of Wilson’s.
It is known that by section of the nerve to a crab’s claw, its
growth is retarded, and as the general growth of the animal
proceeds the claw comes to appear stunted or dwarfed. Now in
such a case as that of Alpheus, we have seen that the rate of
regenerative growth in an amputated large claw fails to let it
reach or overtake the magnitude of the growing little claw:
which latter, in short, now appears as the big one. But if at the
same time as we amputate the big claw we also sever the nerve
to the lesser one, we so far slow down the latter’s growth that
the other is able to make up to it, and in this case the two claws
continue to grow at ap­prox­i­mate­ly equal rates, or in other words
continue of coequal size.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The phenomenon of regeneration goes some way towards
helping us to comprehend the phenomenon of “multiplication by
fission,” as it is exemplified at least in its simpler cases in many
worms and worm-like animals. For physical reasons which we
shall have to study in another chapter, there is a natural tendency
for any tube, if it have the properties of a fluid or semi-fluid
substance, to break up into segments after it comes to a certain
length; and nothing can prevent its doing so, except the presence
of some controlling force, such for instance as may be due to the
pressure of some external support, or some superficial thickening
or other intrinsic rigidity of its own substance. If we add to this
natural tendency towards fission of a cylindrical or tubular worm,
the ordinary phenomenon of regeneration, we have all that is
essentially implied in “reproduction by fission.” And
in so far <span class="xxpn" id="p152">{152}</span>
as the process rests upon a physical principle, or natural tendency,
we may account for its occurrence in a great variety of animals,
zoologically dissimilar; and also for its presence here and absence
there, in forms which, though materially different in a physical
sense, are zoologically speaking very closely allied.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">C<b>ONCLUSION</b></span>
<span class="smmaj">AND</span>

<p>But the phenomena of regeneration, like all the other
phenomena of growth, soon carry us far afield, and we must draw
this brief discussion to a close.</p>

<p>For the main features which appear to be common to all
curves of growth we may hope to have, some day, a physical
explanation. In particular we should like to know the meaning
of that point of inflection, or abrupt change from an increasing
to a decreasing velocity of growth which all our curves, and
especially our acceleration curves, demonstrate the existence of,
provided only that they include the initial stages of the whole
phenomenon: just as we should also like to have a full physical
or physiological explanation of the gradually diminishing velocity
of growth which follows, and which (though subject to temporary
interruption or abeyance) is on the whole char­ac­ter­is­tic of growth in
all cases whatsoever. In short, the char­ac­ter­is­tic form of the curve
of growth in length (or any other linear dimension) is a phenomenon
which we are at present unable to explain, but which presents
us with a definite and attractive problem for future solution.
It would seem evident that the abrupt change in velocity must be
due, either to a change in that pressure outwards from within,
by which the “forces of growth” make themselves manifest, or
to a change in the resistances against which they act, that is to
say the <i>tension</i> of the surface; and this latter force we do not by
any means limit to “surface-tension” proper, but may extend to
the development of a more or less resistant membrane or “skin,”
or even to the resistance of fibres or other histological elements,
binding the boundary layers to the parts within. I take it that
the sudden arrest of velocity is much more likely to be due to a
sudden increase of resistance than to a sudden diminution of
internal energies: in other words, I suspect that it is coincident
with some notable event of histological
differentiation, such as <span class="xxpn" id="p153">{153}</span>
the rapid formation of a comparatively firm skin; and that the
dwindling of velocities, or the negative acceleration, which follows,
is the resultant or composite effect of waning forces of growth on
the one hand, and increasing superficial resistance on the other.
This is as much as to say that growth, while its own energy tends
to increase, leads also, after a while, to the establishment of
resistances which check its own further increase.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of the whole complex phenomenon of growth
is so scanty that it may seem rash to advance even this tentative
suggestion. But yet there are one or two known facts which
seem to bear upon the question, and to indicate at least the manner
in which a varying resistance to expansion may affect the velocity
of growth. For instance, it has been shewn by Frazee<a class="afnanch" href="#fn196" id="fnanch196">196</a>
that
electrical stimulation of tadpoles, with small current density and
low voltage, increases the rate of regenerative growth. As just
such an electrification would tend to lower the surface-tension,
and accordingly decrease the external resistance, the experiment
would seem to support, in some slight degree, the suggestion
which I have made.</p>

<div class="psmprnt3">
<p>Delage<a class="afnanch" href="#fn197"
id="fnanch197">197</a> has lately made use of the principle
of specific rate of growth, in considering the question of
heredity itself. We know that the chromatin of the fertilised
egg comes from the male and female parent alike, in equal or
nearly equal shares; we know that the initial chromatin, so
contributed, multiplies many thousand-fold, to supply the
chromatin for every cell of the offspring’s body; and it has,
therefore, a high “coefficient of growth.” If we admit, with
Van Beneden and others, that the initial contributions of
male and female chromatin continue to be transmitted to the
succeeding generations of cells, we may then conceive these
chromatins to retain each its own coefficient of growth; and if
these differed ever so little, a gradual preponderance of one
or other would make itself felt in time, and might conceivably
explain the preponderating influence of one parent or the other
upon the characters of the offspring. Indeed O. Hertwig is said
(according to Delage’s interpretation) to have actually shewn
that we can artificially modify the rate of growth of one or
other chromatin, and so increase or diminish the influence of
the maternal or paternal heredity. This theory of Delage’s has
its fascination, but it calls for somewhat large assumptions;
and in particular, it seems (like so many other theories
relating to the chromosomes) to rest far too much upon material
elements, rather than on the imponderable dynamic factors of
the cell. <span class="xxpn" id="p154">{154}</span></p>
</div><!--psmprnt3-->

<p>We may summarise, as follows, the main results of the foregoing
discussion:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(1) Except in certain minute organisms and minute parts of
organisms, whose form is due to the direct action of molecular
forces, we may look upon the form of the organism as a “function
of growth,” or a direct expression of a rate of growth which varies
according to its different directions.</p></li>

<li><p>(2) Rate of growth is subject to definite laws, and the
velocities in different directions tend to maintain a <i>ratio</i> which is
more or less constant for each specific organism; and to this
regularity is due the fact that the form of the organism is in general
regular and constant.</p></li>

<li><p>(3) Nevertheless, the ratio of velocities in different directions
is not absolutely constant, but tends to alter or fluctuate in a
regular way; and to these progressive changes are due the
changes of form which accompany “development,” and the slower
changes of form which continue perceptibly in after life.</p></li>

<li><p>(4) The rate of growth is a function of the age of the organism,
it has a maximum somewhat early in life, after which epoch of
maximum it slowly declines.</p></li>

<li><p>(5) The rate of growth is directly affected by temperature,
and by other physical conditions.</p></li>

<li><p>(6) It is markedly affected, in the way of acceleration or
retardation, at certain physiological epochs of life, such as birth,
puberty, or metamorphosis.</p></li>

<li><p>(7) Under certain circumstances, growth may be <i>negative</i>, the
organism growing smaller: and such negative growth is a common
accompaniment of metamorphosis, and a frequent accompaniment
of old age.</p></li>

<li><p>(8) The phenomenon of regeneration is associated with a large
temporary increase in the rate of growth (or “<i>acceleration</i>” of
growth) of the injured surface; in other respects, regenerative
growth is similar to ordinary growth in all its essential phenomena.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>In this discussion of growth, we have left out of account a
vast number of processes, or phenomena, by which, in the physiological
mechanism of the body, growth is effected and controlled.
We have dealt with growth in its relation to
magnitude, and to <span class="xxpn" id="p155">{155}</span>
that relativity of magnitudes which constitutes form; and so we
have studied it as a phenomenon which stands at the beginning
of a morphological, rather than at the end of a physiological
enquiry. Under these restrictions, we have treated it as far as
possible, or in such fashion as our present knowledge permits, on
strictly physical lines.</p>

<p>In all its aspects, and not least in its relation to form, the
growth of organisms has many analogies, some close and some
perhaps more remote, among inanimate things. As the waves
grow when the winds strive with the other forces which govern
the movements of the surface of the sea, as the heap grows when
we pour corn out of a sack, as the crystal grows when from the
surrounding solution the proper molecules fall into their appropriate
places: so in all these cases, very much as in the organism
itself, is growth accompanied by change of form, and by a development
of definite shapes and contours. And in these cases (as
in all other mechanical phenomena), we are led to equate our
various magnitudes with time, and so to recognise that growth is
essentially a question of rate, or of velocity.</p>

<p>The differences of form, and changes of form, which are brought
about by varying rates (or “laws”) of growth, are essentially the
same phenomenon whether they be, so to speak, episodes in the
life-history of the individual, or manifest themselves as the normal
and distinctive char­ac­teris­tics of what we call separate species of
the race. From one form, or ratio of magnitude, to another there
is but one straight and direct road of transformation, be the
journey taken fast or slow; and if the transformation take place
at all, it will in all likelihood proceed in the self-same way, whether
it occur within the life-time of an individual or during the long
ancestral history of a race. No small part of what is known as
Wolff’s or von Baer’s law, that the individual organism tends to
pass through the phases char­ac­ter­is­tic of its ancestors, or that the
life-history of the individual tends to recapitulate the ancestral
history of its race, lies wrapped up in this simple account of the
relation between rate of growth and form.</p>

<p>But enough of this discussion. Let us leave for a while the
subject of the growth of the organism, and attempt to study the
conformation, within and without, of
the individual cell.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="p156"><h2 class="h2herein"
title="IV. On the Internal Form and Structure of the
Cell.">CHAPTER IV<span class="h2ttl">ON THE INTERNAL FORM AND
STRUCTURE OF THE CELL</span></h2></div>

<p>In the early days of the cell-theory, more than seventy years
ago, Goodsir was wont to speak of cells as “centres of growth”
or “centres of nutrition,” and to consider them as essentially
“centres of force.” He looked forward to a time when the forces
connected with the cell should be particularly investigated: when,
that is to say, minute anatomy should be studied in its dynamical
aspect. “When this branch of enquiry,” he says “shall have
been opened up, we shall expect to have a science of organic
forces, having direct relation to anatomy, the science of organic
forms<a class="afnanch" href="#fn198" id="fnanch198">198</a>.”
And likewise, long afterwards, Giard contemplated a
science of <i>morphodynamique</i>,—but still looked upon it as forming
so guarded and hidden a “territoire scientifique, que la plupart
des naturalistes de nos jours ne le verront que comme Moïse vit
la terre promise, seulement de loin et sans pouvoir y entrer<a class="afnanch" href="#fn199" id="fnanch199">199</a>.”</p>

<p>To the external forms of cells, and to the forces which produce
and modify these forms, we shall pay attention in a later chapter.
But there are forms and con­fi­gur­a­tions of matter within the cell,
which also deserve to be studied with due regard to the forces,
known or unknown, of whose resultant they are the visible
expression.</p>

<p>In the long interval since Goodsir’s day, the visible structure,
the conformation and configuration, of the cell, has been studied
far more abundantly than the purely dynamic problems that are
associated therewith. The overwhelming progress of microscopic
observation has multiplied our knowledge of cellular and intracellular
structure; and to the multitude of
visible structures it <span class="xxpn" id="p157">{157}</span>
has been often easier to attribute virtues than to ascribe intelligible
functions or modes of action. But here and there nevertheless,
throughout the whole literature of the subject, we find recognition
of the inevitable fact that dynamical problems lie behind the
morphological problems of the cell.</p>

<p>Bütschli pointed out forty years ago, with emphatic clearness,
the failure of morphological methods, and the need for physical
methods, if we were to penetrate deeper into the essential nature
of the cell<a class="afnanch" href="#fn200" id="fnanch200">200</a>.
And such men as Loeb and Whitman, Driesch and
Roux, and not a few besides, have pursued the same train of
thought and similar methods of enquiry.</p>

<p>Whitman<a class="afnanch" href="#fn201" id="fnanch201">201</a>,
for instance, puts the case in a nutshell when, in
speaking of the so-called “caryokinetic” phenomena of nuclear
division, he reminds us that the leading idea in the term “<i>caryokinesis</i>”
is <i>motion</i>,—“motion viewed as an exponent of forces
residing in, or acting upon, the nucleus. It regards the nucleus
as a <i>seat of energy, which displays itself in phenomena of motion</i><a class="afnanch" href="#fn202" id="fnanch202">202</a>.”</p>

<p>In short it would seem evident that, except in relation to a
dynamical in­ves­ti­ga­tion, the mere study of cell structure has but
little value of its own. That a given cell, an ovum for instance,
contains this or that visible substance or structure, germinal
vesicle or germinal spot, chromatin or achromatin, chromosomes
or centrosomes, obviously gives no explanation of the <i>activities</i> of
the cell. And in all such hypotheses as that of “pangenesis,” in
all the theories which attribute specific
properties to micellae, <span class="xxpn" id="p158">{158}</span>
idioplasts, ids, or other constituent particles of protoplasm or of
the cell, we are apt to fall into the error of attributing to <i>matter</i>
what is due to <i>energy</i> and is manifested in force: or, more strictly
speaking, of attributing to material particles individually what is
due to the energy of their collocation.</p>

<p>The tendency is a very natural one, as knowledge of structure
increases, to ascribe particular virtues to the material structures
themselves, and the error is one into which the disciple is likely
to fall, but of which we need not suspect the master-mind. The
dynamical aspect of the case was in all probability kept well in
view by those who, like Goodsir himself, first attacked the problem
of the cell and originated our conceptions of its nature and
functions.</p>

<p>But if we speak, as Weismann and others speak, of an
“hereditary <i>substance</i>,” a substance which is split off from the
parent-body, and which hands on to the new generation the
char­ac­teris­tics of the old, we can only justify our mode of speech
by the assumption that that particular portion of matter is the
essential vehicle of a particular charge or distribution of energy,
in which is involved the capability of producing motion, or of
doing “work.”</p>

<p>For, as Newton said, to tell us that a thing “is endowed with
an occult specific quality, by which it acts and produces manifest
effects, is to tell us nothing; but to derive two or three general
principles of motion<a class="afnanch" href="#fn203" id="fnanch203">203</a>
from phenomena would be a very great step
in philosophy, though the causes of these principles were not yet
discovered.” The <i>things</i> which we see in the cell are less important
than the <i>actions</i> which we recognise in the cell; and these latter
we must especially scrutinize, in the hope of discovering how far
they may be attributed to the simple and well-known physical
forces, and how far they be relevant or irrelevant to the phenomena
which we associate with, and deem essential to, the manifestation
of <i>life</i>. It may be that in this way we shall in time draw nigh to
the recognition of a specific and ultimate residuum. <span class="xxpn" id="p159">{159}</span></p>

<p>And lacking, as we still do lack, direct knowledge of the actual
forces inherent in the cell, we may yet learn something of their
distribution, if not also of their nature, from the outward and
inward configuration of the cell, and from the changes taking
place in this configuration; that is to say from the movements
of matter, the kinetic phenomena, which the forces in action set up.</p>

<p>The fact that the germ-cell develops into a very complex
structure, is no absolute proof that the cell itself is structurally
a very complicated mechanism: nor yet, though this is somewhat
less obvious, is it sufficient to prove that the forces at work, or
latent, within it are especially numerous and complex. If we blow
into a bowl of soapsuds and raise a great mass of many-hued and
variously shaped bubbles, if we explode a rocket and watch the
regular and beautiful configuration of its falling streamers, if we
consider the wonders of a limestone cavern which a filtering stream
has filled with stalactites, we soon perceive that in all these cases
we have begun with an initial system of very slight complexity,
whose structure in no way foreshadowed the result, and whose
comparatively simple intrinsic forces only play their part by
complex interaction with the equally simple forces of the surrounding
medium. In an earlier age, men sought for the visible embryo,
even for the <i>homunculus</i>, within the reproductive cells; and to
this day, we scrutinize these cells for visible structure, unable to
free ourselves from that old doctrine of “pre-formation<a class="afnanch" href="#fn204" id="fnanch204">204</a>.”</p>

<p>Moreover, the microscope seemed to substantiate the idea
(which we may trace back to Leibniz<a class="afnanch" href="#fn205" id="fnanch205">205</a>
and to Hobbes<a class="afnanch" href="#fn206" id="fnanch206">206</a>),
that
there is no limit to the mechanical complexity which we may
postulate in an organism, and no limit, therefore, to the hypotheses
which we may rest thereon.</p>

<p>But no microscopical examination of a stick of sealing-wax,
no study of the material of which it is
composed, can enlighten <span class="xxpn" id="p160">{160}</span>
us as to its electrical manifestations or properties. Matter of
itself has no power to do, to make, or to become: it is in energy
that all these potentialities reside, energy invisibly associated with
the material system, and in interaction with the energies of the
surrounding universe.</p>

<p>That “function presupposes structure” has been declared an
accepted axiom of biology. Who it was that so formulated the
aphorism I do not know; but as regards the structure of the cell
it harks back to Brücke, with whose demand for a mechanism,
or organisation, within the cell histologists have ever since
been attempting to comply<a class="afnanch" href="#fn207" id="fnanch207">207</a>.
But unless we mean to include
thereby invisible, and merely chemical or molecular, structure,
we come at once on dangerous ground. For we have seen, in
a former chapter, that some minute “organisms” are already
known of such all but infinitesimal magnitudes that everything
which the morphologist is accustomed to conceive as “structure”
has become physically impossible; and moreover recent research
tends generally to reduce, rather than to extend, our conceptions
of the visible structure necessarily inherent in living protoplasm.
The microscopic structure which, in the last resort or in the simplest
cases, it seems to shew, is that of a more or less viscous colloid,
or rather mixture of colloids, and nothing more. Now, as Clerk
Maxwell puts it, in discussing this very problem, “one material
system can differ from another only in the configuration and
motion which it has at a given instant<a class="afnanch" href="#fn208" id="fnanch208">208</a>.”
If we cannot assume
differences in structure, we must assume differences in <i>motion</i>, that
is to say, in <i>energy</i>. And if we cannot do this, then indeed we are
thrown back upon modes of reasoning unauthorised in physical
science, and shall find ourselves constrained to assume, or to
“admit, that the properties of a germ are not those of a purely
material system.” <span class="xxpn" id="p161">{161}</span></p>

<p>But we are by no means necessarily in this dilemma. For
though we come perilously near to it when we contemplate the
lowest orders of magnitude to which life has been attributed, yet
in the case of the ordinary cell, or ordinary egg or germ which is
going to develop into a complex organism, if we have no reason
to assume or to believe that it comprises an intricate “mechanism,”
we may be quite sure, both on direct and indirect evidence, that,
like the powder in our rocket, it is very heterogeneous in its
structure. It is a mixture of substances of various kinds, more
or less fluid, more or less mobile, influenced in various ways by
chemical, electrical, osmotic, and other forces, and in their
admixture separated by a multitude of surfaces, or boundaries, at
which these, or certain of these forces are made manifest.</p>

<p>Indeed, such an arrangement as this is already enough to
constitute a “mechanism”; for we must be very careful not to
let our physical or physiological concept of mechanism be narrowed
to an interpretation of the term derived from the delicate and
complicated contrivances of human skill. From the physical
point of view, we understand by a “mechanism” whatsoever
checks or controls, and guides into determinate paths, the workings
of energy; in other words, whatsoever leads in the degradation
of energy to its manifestation in some determinate form of <i>work</i>,
at a stage short of that ultimate degradation which lapses in
uniformly diffused heat. This, as Warburg has well explained, is
the general effect or function of the physiological machine, and in
particular of that part of it which we call “cell-structure<a class="afnanch" href="#fn209" id="fnanch209">209</a>.”
The normal muscle-cell is something which turns energy, derived
from oxidation, into work; it is a mechanism which arrests and
utilises the chemical energy of oxidation in its downward course;
but the same cell when injured or disintegrated, loses its “usefulness,”
and sets free a greatly increased proportion of its energy
in the form of heat.</p>

<p>But very great and wonderful things are done after this manner
by means of a mechanism (whether natural or artificial) of
extreme simplicity. A pool of water, by
virtue of its surface, <span class="xxpn" id="p162">{162}</span>
is an admirable mechanism for the making of waves; with a lump
of ice in it, it becomes an efficient and self-contained mechanism
for the making of currents. The great cosmic mechanisms are
stupendous in their simplicity; and, in point of fact, every great
or little aggregate of heterogeneous matter (not identical in
“phase”) involves, <i>ipso facto</i>, the essentials of a mechanism.
Even a non-living colloid, from its intrinsic heterogeneity, is in
this sense a mechanism, and one in which energy is manifested
in the movement and ceaseless rearrangement of the constituent
particles. For this reason Graham (if I remember rightly) speaks
somewhere or other of the colloid state as “the dynamic state of
matter”; or in the same philosopher’s phrase (of which Mr
Hardy<a class="afnanch" href="#fn210" id="fnanch210">210</a>
has lately reminded us), it possesses “<i>energia</i><a class="afnanch" href="#fn211" id="fnanch211">211</a>.”</p>

<p>Let us turn then to consider, briefly and dia­gram­ma­ti­cally, the
structure of the cell, a fertilised germ-cell or ovum for instance,
not in any vain attempt to correlate this structure with the
structure or properties of the resulting and yet distant organism;
but merely to see how far, by the study of its form and its changing
internal configuration, we may throw light on certain forces which
are for the time being at work within it.</p>

<p>We may say at once that we can scarcely hope to learn more
of these forces, in the first instance, than a few facts regarding
their direction and magnitude; the nature and specific identity
of the force or forces is a very different matter. This latter
problem is likely to be very difficult of elucidation, for the reason,
among others, that very different forces are often very much alike
in their outward and visible manifestations. So it has come to
pass that we have a multitude of discordant hypotheses as to the
nature of the forces acting within the cell, and producing, in cell
division, the “caryokinetic” figures of which we are about to
speak. One student may, like Rhumbler, choose to account for
them by an hypothesis of mechanical traction, acting on a reticular
web of protoplasm<a class="afnanch" href="#fn212" id="fnanch212">212</a>;
another, like
Leduc, may shew us how in <span class="xxpn" id="p163">{163}</span>
many of their most striking features they may be admirably
simulated by the diffusion of salts in a colloid medium; others
again, like Gallardo<a class="afnanch" href="#fn213" id="fnanch213">213</a>
and Hartog, and Rhumbler (in his earlier
papers)<a class="afnanch" href="#fn214" id="fnanch214">214</a>,
insist on their resemblance to the phenomena of
electricity and magnetism<a class="afnanch" href="#fn215" id="fnanch215">215</a>;
while Hartog believes that the force
in question is only analogous to these, and has a specific identity
of its own<a class="afnanch" href="#fn216" id="fnanch216">216</a>.
All these conflicting views are of secondary importance,
so long as we seek only to account for certain <i>con­fi­gur­a­tions</i>
which reveal the direction, rather than the nature, of a force.
One and the same system of lines of force may appear in a field
of magnetic or of electrical energy, of the osmotic energy of
diffusion, of the gravitational energy of a flowing stream. In short,
we may expect to learn something of the pure or abstract dynamics,
long before we can deal with the special physics of the cell. For
indeed (as Maillard has suggested), just as uniform expansion
about a single centre, to whatsoever physical cause it may be due
will lead to the configuration of a sphere, so will any two centres
or foci of potential (of whatsoever kind) lead to the con­fi­gur­a­tions
with which Faraday made us familiar under the name of “lines
of force<a class="afnanch" href="#fn217" id="fnanch217">217</a>”;
and this is as much as to say
that the phenomenon, <span class="xxpn" id="p164">{164}</span>
though physical in the concrete, is in the abstract purely math­e­mat­i­cal,
and in its very essence is neither more nor less than <i>a
property of three-dimensional space</i>.</p>

<p>But as a matter of fact, in this instance, that is to say in
trying to explain the leading phenomena of the caryokinetic
division of the cell, we shall soon perceive that any explanation
which is based, like Rhumbler’s, on mere mechanical traction, is
obviously inadequate, and we shall find ourselves limited to the
hypothesis of some polarised and polarising force, such as we deal
with, for instance, in the phenomena of magnetism or electricity.</p>

<p>Let us speak first of the cell itself, as it appears in a state of
rest, and let us proceed afterwards to study the more active
phenomena which accompany its division.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Our typical cell is a spherical body; that is to say, the uniform
surface-tension at its boundary is balanced by the outward
resistance of uniform forces within. But at times the surface-tension
may be a fluctuating quantity, as when it produces the
rhythmical contractions or “Ransom’s waves” on the surface of
a trout’s egg; or again, while the egg is in contact with other
bodies, the surface-tension may be locally unequal and variable,
giving rise to an amoeboid figure, as in the egg of Hydra<a class="afnanch" href="#fn218" id="fnanch218">218</a>.</p>

<p>Within the ovum is a nucleus or germinal vesicle, also spherical,
and consisting as a rule of portions of “chromatin,” aggregated
together within a more fluid drop. The fact has often been
commented upon that, in cells generally, there is no correlation
of <i>form</i> (though there apparently is of <i>size</i>) between the nucleus
and the “cytoplasm,” or main body of the cell. So Whitman<a class="afnanch" href="#fn219" id="fnanch219">219</a>
remarks that “except during the process of division the nucleus
seldom departs from its typical spherical form. It divides and
sub-divides, ever returning to the same round or oval
form&#x200a;....&#x200a;How different with the cell. It preserves the spherical form as
rarely as the nucleus departs from it. Variation in form marks
the beginning and the end of every important
chapter in its <span class="xxpn" id="p165">{165}</span>
history.” On simple dynamical grounds, the contrast is easily
explained. So long as the fluid substance of the nucleus is qualitatively
different from, and incapable of mixing with, the fluid
or semi-fluid protoplasm which surrounds it, we shall expect it
to be, as it almost always is, of spherical form. For, on the one
hand, it is bounded by a liquid film, whose surface-tension is
uniform; and on the other, it is immersed in a medium which
transmits on all sides a uniform fluid pressure<a class="afnanch" href="#fn220" id="fnanch220">220</a>.
For a similar
reason the contractile vacuole of a Protozoon is spherical in form:
it is just a “drop” of fluid, bounded by a uniform surface-tension
and through whose boundary-film diffusion is taking place.
But here, owning to the small difference between the fluid constituting,
and that surrounding, the drop, the surface-tension equi­lib­rium
is unstable; it is apt to vanish, and the rounded outline
of the drop, like a burst bubble, disappears in a moment<a class="afnanch" href="#fn221" id="fnanch221">221</a>.
The case of the spherical nucleus is closely akin to the spherical
form of the yolk within the bird’s egg<a class="afnanch" href="#fn222" id="fnanch222">222</a>.
But if the substance of
the cell acquire a greater solidity, as for
instance in a muscle <span class="xxpn" id="p166">{166}</span>
cell, or by reason of mucous accumulations in an epithelium cell,
then the laws of fluid pressure no longer apply, the external
pressure on the nucleus tends to become unsymmetrical, and its
shape is modified accordingly. “Amoeboid” movements may be
set up in the nucleus by anything which disturbs the symmetry of
its own surface-tension. And the cases, as in many Rhizopods,
where “nuclear material” is scattered in small portions throughout
the cell instead of being aggregated in a single nucleus, are probably
capable of very simple explanation by supposing that the “phase
difference” (as the chemists say) between the nuclear and the
protoplasmic substance is comparatively slight, and the surface-tension
which tends to keep them separate is correspondingly
small<a class="afnanch" href="#fn223" id="fnanch223">223</a>.</p>

<p>It has been shewn that ordinary nuclei, isolated in a living
or fresh state, easily flow together; and this fact is enough to
suggest that they are aggregations of a particular substance rather
than bodies deserving the name of particular organs. It is by
reason of the same tendency to confluence or aggregation of
particles that the ordinary nucleus is itself formed, until the
imposition of a new force leads to its disruption.</p>

<p>Apart from that invisible or ultra-microscopic heterogeneity
which is inseparable from our notion of a “colloid,” there is a
visible heterogeneity of structure within both the nucleus and the
outer protoplasm. The former, for instance, contains a rounded
nucleolus or “germinal spot,” certain conspicuous granules or
strands of the peculiar substance called chromatin, and a coarse
meshwork of a protoplasmic material known as “linin” or achromatin;
the outer protoplasm, or cytoplasm, is generally believed
to consist throughout of a sponge-work, or rather alveolar meshwork,
of more and less fluid substances; and lastly, there are
generally to be detected one or more very minute bodies, usually
in the cytoplasm, sometimes within the nucleus, known as the
centrosome or centrosomes.</p>

<p>The morphologist is accustomed to speak of
a “polarity” of <span class="xxpn" id="p167">{167}</span>
the cell, meaning thereby a symmetry of visible structure about
a particular axis. For instance, whenever we can recognise in
a cell both a nucleus and a centrosome, we may consider a
line drawn through the two as the morphological axis of polarity;
in an epithelium cell, it is obvious that the cell is morphologically
symmetrical about a median axis passing from its free surface to
its attached base. Again, by an extension of the term “polarity,”
as is customary in dynamics, we may have a “radial” polarity,
between centre and periphery; and lastly, we may have several
apparently independent centres of polarity within the single cell.
Only in cells of quite irregular, or amoeboid form, do we fail to
recognise a definite and symmetrical “polarity.” The <i>morphological</i>
“polarity” is accompanied by, and is but the outward
expression (or part of it) of a true <i>dynamical</i> polarity, or distribution
of forces; and the “lines of force” are rendered visible by concatenation
of particles of matter, such as come under the influence
of the forces in action.</p>

<p>When the lines of force stream inwards from the periphery
towards a point in the interior of the cell, the particles susceptible
of attraction either crowd towards the surface of the cell, or, when
retarded by friction, are seen forming lines or “fibrillae” which
radiate outwards from the centre and constitute a so-called
“aster.” In the cells of columnar or ciliated epithelium, where
the sides of the cell are symmetrically disposed to their neighbours
but the free and attached surfaces are very diverse from one
another in their external relations, it is these latter surfaces which
constitute the opposite poles; and in accordance with the parallel
lines of force so set up, we very frequently see parallel lines of
granules which have ranged themselves perpendicularly to the
free surface of the cell (cf. fig. <a href="#fig97" title="go to Fig. 97">97</a>).</p>

<p>A simple manifestation of “polarity” may be well illustrated
by the phenomenon of diffusion, where we may conceive, and may
automatically reproduce, a “field of force,” with its poles and
visible lines of equipotential, very much as in Faraday’s conception
of the field of force of a magnetic system. Thus, in one of Leduc’s
experiments<a class="afnanch" href="#fn224" id="fnanch224">224</a>,
if we spread a layer of salt
solution over a level <span class="xxpn" id="p168">{168}</span>
plate of glass, and let fall into the middle of it a drop of indian
ink, or of blood, we shall find the coloured particles travelling
outwards from the central “pole of concentration” along the lines
of diffusive force, and so mapping out for us a “monopolar field”
of diffusion: and if we set two such drops side by side, their
lines of diffusion will oppose, and repel, one another. Or, instead
of the uniform layer of salt solution, we may place at a little
distance from one another a grain of salt and a drop of blood,
representing two opposite poles: and so obtain a picture of a
“bipolar field” of diffusion. In either case, we obtain results
closely analogous to the “morphological,” but really <i>dynamical</i>,
polarity of the organic cell. But in all probability, the dynamical
polarity, or asymmetry of the cell is a very complicated phenomenon:
for the obvious reason that, in any system, one asymmetry
will tend to beget another. A chemical asymmetry will induce an
inequality of surface-tension, which will lead directly to a modification
of form; the chemical asymmetry may in turn be due to a
process of electrolysis in a polarised electrical field; and again
the chemical heterogeneity may be intensified into a chemical
“polarity,” by the tendency of certain substances to seek a locus
of greater or less surface-energy. We need not attempt to
grapple with a subject so complicated, and leading to so many
problems which lie beyond the sphere of interest of the morphologist.
But yet the morphologist, in his study of the cell,
cannot quite evade these important issues; and we shall return
to them again when we have dealt somewhat with the form of
the cell, and have taken account of some of the simpler phenomena
of surface-tension.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>We are now ready, and in some measure prepared, to study
the numerous and complex phenomena which usually accompany
the division of the cell, for instance of the fertilised egg.</p>

<p>Division of the cell is essentially accompanied, and preceded,
by a change from radial or monopolar to a definitely bipolar
polarity.</p>

<p>In the hitherto quiescent, or apparently quiescent cell, we perceive
certain movements, which correspond precisely to what must
accompany and result from a “polarisation” of
forces within the <span class="xxpn" id="p169">{169}</span>
cell: of forces which, whatever may be their specific nature, at least
are capable of polarisation, and of producing consequent attraction
or repulsion between charged particles of matter. The opposing
forces which were distributed in equi­lib­rium throughout the substance
of the cell become focussed at two “centrosomes,” which
may or may not be already distinguished as visible portions of
matter; in the egg, one of these is always near to, and the other
remote from, the “animal pole” of the egg, which pole is visibly
as well as chemically different from the other, and is the region in
which the more rapid and conspicuous developmental changes will
presently begin. Between the two centrosomes, a spindle-shaped</p>

<p class="pcontinue">figure appears, whose striking resemblance to the lines of force
made visible by iron-filings between the poles of a magnet, was at
once recognised by Hermann Fol, when in 1873 he witnessed for
the first time the phenomenon in question. On the farther side
of the centrosomes are seen star-like figures, or “asters,” in which
we can without difficulty recognise the broken lines of force which
run externally to those stronger lines which lie nearer to the polar
axis and which constitute the “spindle.” The lines of force are
rendered visible or “material,” just as in the experiment of the
iron-filings, by the fact that, in the heterogeneous substance of
the cell, certain portions of matter are more “permeable” to the
acting force than the rest, become themselves
polarised after the <span class="xxpn" id="p170">{170}</span>
fashion of a magnetic or “paramagnetic” body, arrange themselves
in an orderly way between the two poles of the field of force, cling
to one another as it were in threads<a class="afnanch" href="#fn225" id="fnanch225">225</a>,
and are only prevented by
the friction of the surrounding medium from approaching and
congregating around the adjacent poles.</p>

<p>As the field of force strengthens, the more will the lines of force
be drawn in towards the interpolar axis, and the less evident will
be those remoter lines which constitute the terminal, or extrapolar,
asters: a clear space, free from materialised lines of force, may
thus tend to be set up on either side of the spindle, the
so-called “Bütschli space” of the histologists<a class="afnanch" href="#fn226" id="fnanch226">226</a>.
On the other
hand, the lines of force constituting the spindle will be less concentrated
if they find a path of less resistance at the periphery
of the cell: as happens, in our experiment of the iron-filings, when
we encircle the field of force with an iron ring. On this principle,
the differences observed between cells in which the spindle is well
developed and the asters small, and others in which the spindle
is weak and the asters enormously developed, can be easily
explained by variations in the potential of the field, the large,
conspicuous asters being probably correlated with a marked
permeability of the surface of the cell.</p>

<p>The visible field of force, though often called the “nuclear
spindle,” is formed outside of, but usually near to, the nucleus.
Let us look a little more closely into the structure of this body,
and into the changes which it presently undergoes.</p>

<p>Within its spherical outline (Fig. <a href="#fig42" title="go to Fig. 42">42</a>), it
contains an “alveolar” <span class="xxpn" id="p171">{171}</span>
meshwork (often described, from its appearance in optical section,
as a “reticulum”), consisting of more solid substances, with more
fluid matter filling up the interalveolar meshes. This phenomenon
is nothing else than what we call in ordinary language, a “froth”
or a “foam.” It is a surface-tension phenomenon, due to the
interacting surface-tensions of two intermixed fluids, not very
different in density, as they strive to separate. Of precisely the
same kind (as Bütschli was the first to shew) are the minute alveolar
networks which are to be discerned in the cytoplasm of the cell<a class="afnanch" href="#fn227" id="fnanch227">227</a>,
and which we now know to be not inherent in the nature of
protoplasm, or of living matter in general, but to be due to various
causes, natural as well as artificial. The microscopic honeycomb
structure of cast metal under various conditions of cooling, even
on a grand scale the columnar structure of basaltic rock, is an
example of the same surface-tension phenomenon. <span class="xxpn" id="p172">{172}</span></p>

<div class="psmprnt3">
<p>But here we touch the brink of a subject so important that we
must not pass it by without a word, and yet so contentious
that we must not enter into its details. The question involved
is simply whether the great mass of recorded observations
and accepted beliefs with regard to the visible structure
of protoplasm and of the cell constitute a fair picture of
the actual <i>living cell</i>, or be based on appearances which
are incident to death itself and to the artificial treatment
which the microscopist is accustomed to apply. The great bulk
of histological work is done by methods which involve the
sudden killing of the cell or organism by strong reagents,
the assumption being that death is so rapid that the visible
phenomena exhibited during life are retained or “fixed” in our
preparations. While this assumption is reasonable and justified
as regards the general outward form of small organisms or
of individual cells, enough has been done of late years to
shew that the case is totally different in the case of the
minute internal networks, granules, etc., which represent the
alleged <i>structure</i> of protoplasm. For, as Hardy puts it, “It
is notorious that the various fixing reagents are coagulants
of organic colloids, and that they produce precipitates which
have a certain figure or structure,&#x200a;...&#x200a;and
that the figure varies, other things being equal, according
to the reagent used.” So it comes to pass that some writers<a
class="afnanch" href="#fn228" id="fnanch228">228</a> have
altogether denied the existence in the living cell-protoplasm
of a network or alveolar “foam”; others<a class="afnanch"
href="#fn229" id="fnanch229">229</a> have cast doubts on the
main tenets of recent histology regarding nuclear structure;
and Hardy, discussing the structure of certain gland-cells,
declares that “there is no evidence that the structure
discoverable in the cell-substance of these cells after
fixation has any counterpart in the cell when living.” “A large
part of it” he goes on to say “is an artefact. The profound
difference in the minute structure of a secretory cell of a
mucous gland according to the reagent which is used to fix
it would, it seems to me, almost suffice to establish this
statement in the absence of other evidence.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, histological study proceeds, especially on
the part of the morphologists, with but little change in
theory or in method, in spite of these and many other
warnings. That certain visible structures, nucleus, vacuoles,
“attraction-spheres” or centrosomes, etc., are actually
present in the living cell, we know for certain; and to this
class belong the great majority of structures (including
the nuclear “spindle” itself) with which we are at present
concerned. That many other alleged structures are artificial
has also been placed beyond a doubt; but where to draw
the dividing line we often do not know<a class="afnanch"

<li><p>1. The chromatin, which to begin with was distributed in
granules on the otherwise achromatic reticulum (Fig. <a href="#fig42" title="go to Fig. 42">42</a>), concentrates
to form a skein or <i>spireme</i>, which may be a continuous
thread from the first (Figs. <a href="#fig43" title="go to Fig. 43">43</a>, 44), or from the first segmented.
In any case it divides transversely sooner or later into a number
of <i>chromosomes</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig45" title="go to Fig. 45">45</a>), which as a rule have the shape of little
rods, straight or curved, often bent into a V, but which may
also be ovoid, or round, or even annular. Certain deeply staining
masses, the nucleoli, which may be present in the resting nucleus,
do not take part in the process of chromosome formation; they
are either cast out of the nucleus and are dissolved in the cytoplasm,
or fade away <i>in situ</i>.</p></li>

<li><p>2. Meanwhile, the deeply staining granule (here extra-nuclear),
known as the <i>centrosome</i>, has divided in two. The two
resulting granules travel to opposite poles
of the nucleus, and <span class="xxpn" id="p174">{174}</span>
there each becomes surrounded by a system of radiating lines, the
<i>asters</i>; immediately around the centrosome is a clear space, the
<i>centrosphere</i> (Figs. <a href="#fig43" title="go to Fig. 43">43</a>–45). Between the two centrosomes with
their asters stretches a bundle of achromatic fibres, the <i>spindle</i>.</p></li>

<li><p>3. The surface-film bounding the nucleus has broken down,
the definite nuclear boundaries are lost, and the spindle now
stretches through the nuclear material, in which lie the chromosomes
(Figs. <a href="#fig45" title="go to Fig. 45">45</a>, 46). These chromosomes now arrange themselves
midway between the poles of the spindle, where they form
what is called the <i>equatorial plate</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig47" title="go to Fig. 47">47</a>).</p>

at this stage,—but it is to be noticed that the splitting may have
taken place so early as the spireme stage (Fig.
<a href="#fig48" title="go to Fig. 48">48</a>).</p></li>

<li><p>5. The halves of the split chromosomes now separate from
one another, and travel in opposite directions towards the two
poles (Fig. <a href="#fig49" title="go to Fig. 49">49</a>). As they move, it becomes apparent that the spindle
consists of a median bundle of “fibres,” the central spindle, running
from pole to pole, and a more superficial sheath of “mantle-fibres,”
to which the chromosomes seem to be attached, and by
which they seem to be drawn towards the asters.</p></li>

become closely crowded in a mass near the centre
of each aster <span class="xxpn" id="p175">{175}</span>

equatorial plate, there has appeared during the migration of
the chromosomes, a “cell-plate” of deeply staining thickenings

<p>The whole, or very nearly the whole of these nuclear phenomena
may be brought into relation with that polarisation of forces, in
the cell as a whole, whose field is made manifest by the “spindle”
and “asters” of which we have already spoken: certain particular
phenomena, directly attributable to surface-tension and diffusion,
taking place in more or less obvious and inevitable dependence
upon the polar system&#x2a;.</p>

<p class="ptblfn">&#x2a; The reference numbers in the following account
refer to the paragraphs and figures of the preceding
summary of visible nuclear phenomena.</p>

<p>At the same time, in attempting to explain the phenomena, we
cannot say too clearly, or too often, that all that we are meanwhile
justified in doing is to try to shew that such and such actions lie
<i>within the range</i> of known physical actions and phenomena, or that
known physical phenomena produce effects similar to them. We
want to feel sure that the whole phenomenon is not <i>sui generis</i>, but
is somehow or other capable of being referred to dynamical laws,
and to the general principles of physical science. But when we
speak of some particular force or mode of action, using it as an
illustrative hypothesis, we must stop far short of the implication
that this or that force is necessarily the very one which is actually
at work within the living cell; and certainly we need not attempt
the formidable task of trying to reconcile, or to choose between,
the various hypotheses which have already been enunciated, or
the several assumptions on which they depend.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Any region of space within which action is manifested is a
field of force; and a simple example is a bipolar field, in which
the action is symmetrical with reference to the line joining two
points, or poles, and also with reference to the “equatorial”
plane equidistant from both. We have such
a “field of force” in <span class="xxpn" id="p177">{177}</span>
the neighbourhood of the centrosome of the ripe cell or ovum,
when it is about to divide; and by the time the centrosome has
divided, the field is definitely a bipolar one.</p>

<p>The <i>quality</i> of a medium filling the field of force may be uniform,
or it may vary from point to point. In particular, it may depend
upon the magnitude of the field; and the quality of one medium
may differ from that of another. Such variation of quality,
within one medium, or from one medium to another, is capable
of diagrammatic representation by a variation of the direction or
the strength of the field (other conditions being the same) from the
state manifested in some uniform medium taken as a standard.
The medium is said to be <i>permeable</i> to the force, in greater or less
degree than the standard medium, according as the variation of
the density of the lines of force from the standard case, under
otherwise identical conditions, is in excess or defect. <i>A body
placed in the medium will tend to move towards regions of greater or
less force according as its permeability is greater or less than that of
the surrounding medium</i><a class="afnanch" href="#fn232" id="fnanch232">232</a>.
In the common experiment of placing
iron-filings between the two poles of a magnetic field, the filings
have a very high permeability; and not only do they themselves
become polarised so as to attract one another, but they tend to
be attracted from the weaker to the stronger parts of the field, and
as we have seen, were it not for friction or some other resistance,
they would soon gather together around the nearest pole. But
if we repeat the same experiment with such a metal as bismuth,
which is very little permeable to the magnetic force, then the
conditions are reversed, and the particles, being repelled from the
stronger to the weaker parts of the field, tend to take up their
position as far from the poles as possible. The particles have
become polarised, but in a sense opposite to that of the surrounding,
or adjacent, field.</p>

<p>Now, in the field of force whose opposite
poles are marked by <span class="xxpn" id="p178">{178}</span>
the centrosomes the nucleus appears to act as a more or less permeable
body, as a body more permeable than the surrounding medium,
that is to say the “cytoplasm” of the cell. It is accordingly
attracted by, and drawn into, the field of force, and tries, as it
were, to set itself between the poles and as far as possible from
both of them. In other words, the centrosome-foci will be
apparently drawn over its surface, until the nucleus as a whole
is involved within the field of force, which is visibly marked out
by the “spindle” (par. 3, Figs. <a href="#fig44" title="go to Fig. 44">44</a>, 45).</p>

<p>If the field of force be electrical, or act in a fashion analogous
to an electrical field, the charged nucleus will have its surface-tensions
diminished<a class="afnanch" href="#fn233" id="fnanch233">233</a>:
with the double result that the inner
alveolar meshwork will be broken up (par. 1), and that the
spherical boundary of the whole nucleus will disappear (par. 2).
The break-up of the alveoli (by thinning and rupture of their
partition walls) leads to the formation of a net, and the further
break-up of the net may lead to the unravelling of a thread or
“spireme” (Figs. <a href="#fig43" title="go to Fig. 43">43</a>, 44).</p>

<p>Here there comes into play a fundamental principle which,
in so far as we require to understand it, can be explained in simple
words. The effect (and we might even say the <i>object</i>) of drawing
the more permeable body in between the poles, is to obtain an
“easier path” by which the lines of force may travel; but it is
obvious that a longer route through the more permeable body
may at length be found less advantageous than a shorter route
through the less permeable medium. That is to say, the more
permeable body will only tend to be drawn in to the field of force
until a point is reached where (so to speak) the way <i>round</i> and
the way <i>through</i> are equally advantageous. We should accordingly
expect that (on our hypothesis) there would be found cases in
which the nucleus was wholly, and others in which it was only
partially, and in greater or less degree, drawn in to the field
between the centrosomes. This is precisely what is found to
occur in actual fact. Figs. <a href="#fig44" title="go to Fig. 44">44</a> and 45 represent two so-called
“types,” of a phase which follows that represented in Fig. <a href="#fig43" title="go to Fig. 43">43</a>.
According to the usual descriptions (and in
particular to Professor <span class="xxpn" id="p179">{179}</span>
E. B. Wilson’s<a class="afnanch" href="#fn234" id="fnanch234">234</a>),
we are told that, in such a case as Fig. <a href="#fig44" title="go to Fig. 44">44</a>, the
“primary spindle” disappears and the centrosomes diverge to
opposite poles of the nucleus; such a condition being found in
many plant-cells, and in the cleavage-stages of many eggs. In
Fig. <a href="#fig45" title="go to Fig. 45">45</a>, on the other hand, the primary spindle persists, and
subsequently comes to form the main or “central” spindle;
while at the same time we see the fading away of the nuclear
membrane, the breaking up of the spireme into separate chromosomes,
and an ingrowth into the nuclear area of the “astral rays,”—all
as in Fig. <a href="#fig46" title="go to Fig. 46">46</a>, which represents the next succeeding phase of
Fig. <a href="#fig45" title="go to Fig. 45">45</a>. This condition, of Fig. <a href="#fig46" title="go to Fig. 46">46</a>, occurs in a variety of cases;
it is well seen in the epidermal cells of the salamander, and is
also on the whole char­ac­ter­is­tic of the mode of formation of the
“polar bodies.” It is clear and obvious that the two “types”
correspond to mere differences of degree, and are such as would
naturally be brought about by differences in the relative permeabilities
of the nuclear mass and of the surrounding cytoplasm,
or even by differences in the magnitude of the former body.</p>

<p>But now an important change takes place, or rather an
important difference appears; for, whereas the nucleus as a whole
tended to be drawn in to the <i>stronger</i> parts of the field, when it
comes to break up we find, on the contrary, that its contained
spireme-thread or separate chromosomes tend to be repelled to
the <i>weaker</i> parts. Whatever this difference may be due to,—whether,
for instance, to actual differences of permeability, or
possibly to differences in “surface-charge,”—the fact is that the
chromatin substance now <i>behaves</i> after the fashion of a “diamagnetic”
body, and is repelled from the stronger to the weaker
parts of the field. In other words, its particles, lying in the
inter-polar field, tend to travel towards the equatorial plane
thereof (Figs. <a href="#fig47" title="go to Fig. 47">47</a>, 48), and further tend to move outwards towards
the periphery of that plane, towards what the histologist
calls the “mantle-fibres,” or outermost of the lines of force of
which the spindle is made up (par. 5, Fig. <a href="#fig47" title="go to Fig. 47">47</a>). And if this comparatively
non-permeable chromatin substance come to consist of
separate portions, more or less elongated in form, these portions,
or separate “chromosomes,” will adjust
themselves longitudinally, <span class="xxpn" id="p180">{180}</span>
in a peripheral equatorial circle (Figs. <a href="#fig48" title="go to Fig. 48">48</a>, 49). This is precisely
what actually takes place. Moreover, before the breaking up of
the nucleus, long before the chromatin material has broken up
into separate chromosomes, and at the very time when it is being
fashioned into a “spireme,” this body already lies in a polar field,
and must already have a tendency to set itself in the equatorial
plane thereof. But the long, continuous spireme thread is unable,
so long as the nucleus retains its spherical boundary wall, to
adjust itself in a simple equatorial annulus; in striving to do so,
it must tend to coil and “kink” itself, and in so doing (if all this
be so), it must tend to assume the char­ac­ter­is­tic convolutions of
the “spireme.”</p>

 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 52. Chromosomes, undergoing
 splitting and separation.<br />(After Hatschek and Flemming,
 diagrammatised.)</div></div>

<p>After the spireme has broken up into separate chromosomes,
these particles come into a position of temporary, and unstable,
equi­lib­rium near the periphery of the equatorial plane, and
here they tend to place themselves in a symmetrical arrangement
(Fig. <a href="#fig52" title="go to Fig. 52">52</a>). The particles are rounded, linear, sometimes
annular, similar in form and size to one another; and
lying as they do in a fluid, and subject to a symmetrical system
of forces, it is not surprising that they arrange themselves
in a symmetrical manner, the precise arrangement depending
on the form of the particles themselves. This symmetry may
perhaps be due, as has already been suggested, to induced
electrical charges. In discussing Brauer’s observations on the
splitting of the chromatic filament, and the symmetrical arrangement
of the separate granules, in
<i>Ascaris megalocephala</i>, Lillie<a class="afnanch" href="#fn235" id="fnanch235">235</a>
<span class="xxpn" id="p181">{181}</span>
remarks: “This behaviour is strongly suggestive of the division
of a colloidal particle under the influence of its surface electrical
charge, and of the effects of mutual repulsion in keeping the
products of division apart.” It is also probable that surface-tensions
between the particles and the surrounding protoplasm
would bring about an identical result, and would sufficiently
account for the obvious, and at first sight, very curious, symmetry.
We know that if we float a couple of matches in water they tend
to approach one another, till they lie close together, side by side;
and, if we lay upon a smooth wet plate four matches, half broken
across, a precisely similar attraction brings the four matches
together in the form of a symmetrical cross. Whether one of
these, or some other, be the actual explanation of the phenomenon,
it is at least plain that by some physical cause, some mutual and
symmetrical attraction or repulsion of the particles, we must seek</p>

<p>So far as we have now gone, there is no great difficulty in
pointing to simple and familiar phenomena of a field of force
which are similar, or comparable, to the phenomena which we
witness within the cell. But among these latter phenomena
there are others for which it is not so easy to suggest, in accordance
with known laws, a simple mode of physical causation. It is not
at once obvious how, in any simple system
of symmetrical forces, <span class="xxpn" id="p182">{182}</span>
the chromosomes, which had at first been apparently repelled
from the poles towards the equatorial plane, should then be split
asunder, and should presently be attracted in opposite directions,
some to one pole and some to the other. Remembering that it is
not our purpose to <i>assert</i> that some one particular mode of action
is at work, but merely to shew that there do exist physical forces,
or distributions of force, which are capable of producing the
required result, I give the following suggestive hypothesis, which
I owe to my colleague Professor W. Peddie.</p>

<p>As we have begun by supposing that the nuclear, or chromosomal
matter differs in <i>permeability</i> from the medium, that is to
say the cytoplasm, in which it lies, let us now make the further
assumption that its permeability is variable, and depends upon the
<i>strength of the field</i>.</p>

<div class="dctr01" id="fig54">
<img src="images/i182.png" width="800" height="470" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 54.</div></div>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig54" title="go to Fig. 54">54</a>, we have a field of force (representing our cell),
consisting of a homogeneous medium, and including two opposite
poles: lines of force are indicated by full lines, and <i>loci of constant
magnitude of force</i> are shewn by dotted lines.</p>

<p>Let us now consider a body whose permeability (µ) depends
on the strength of the field <i>F</i>. At two field-strengths, such
as <i>F&#xfeff;<sub>a</sub></i>, <i>F&#xfeff;<sub>b</sub></i>, let the permeability
of the body be equal to that of the <span class="xxpn"
id="p183">{183}</span> medium, and let the curved line
in Fig. <a href="#fig55" title="go to Fig. 55">55</a> represent generally its permeability at other
field-strengths; and let the outer and inner dotted curves in
Fig. <a href="#fig54" title="go to Fig. 54">54</a> represent respectively the loci of the field-strengths
<i>F&#xfeff;<sub>b</sub></i> and <i>F&#xfeff;<sub>a</sub></i>. The body if it be placed
in the medium within either branch of the inner curve,
or outside the outer curve, will tend to move into the
neighbourhood of the adjacent pole. If it be placed in the
region intermediate to the two dotted curves, it will tend to
move towards regions of weaker field-strength.</p>

<div class="dctr05" id="fig55">
<img src="images/i183.png" width="500" height="381" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 55.</div></div>

<p>The locus <i>F&#xfeff;<sub>b</sub></i> is therefore a locus of stable position, towards
which the body tends to move; the locus <i>F&#xfeff;<sub>a</sub></i> is a locus of unstable
position, from which it tends to move. If the body were placed
across <i>F&#xfeff;<sub>a</sub></i>, it might be torn asunder into two portions, the split
coinciding with the locus <i>F&#xfeff;<sub>a</sub></i>.</p>

<p>Suppose a number of such bodies to be scattered throughout
the medium. Let at first the regions <i>F&#xfeff;<sub>a</sub></i> and <i>F&#xfeff;<sub>b</sub></i> be entirely outside
the space where the bodies are situated: and, in making this
supposition we may, if we please, suppose that the loci which we
are calling <i>F&#xfeff;<sub>a</sub></i> and <i>F&#xfeff;<sub>b</sub></i> are meanwhile situated somewhat farther
from the axis than in our figure, that (for instance) <i>F&#xfeff;<sub>a</sub></i> is situated
where we have drawn <i>F&#xfeff;<sub>b</sub></i>, and that <i>F&#xfeff;<sub>b</sub></i> is still further out. The
bodies then tend towards the poles; but the tendency may be
very small if, in Fig. <a href="#fig55" title="go to Fig. 55">55</a>, the curve and its intersecting straight line
do not diverge very far from one another beyond
<i>F&#xfeff;<sub>a</sub></i>; in other <span class="xxpn" id="p184">{184}</span>
words, if, when situated in this region, the permeability of the
bodies is not very much in excess of that of the medium.</p>

<p>Let the poles now tend to separate farther and farther from
one another, the strength of each pole remaining unaltered; in
other words, let the centrosome-foci recede from one another, as
they actually do, drawing out the spindle-threads between them.
The loci <i>F&#xfeff;<sub>a</sub></i>, <i>F&#xfeff;<sub>b</sub></i>, will close in to nearer relative distances from the
poles. In doing so, when the locus <i>F&#xfeff;<sub>a</sub></i> crosses one of the bodies,
the body may be torn asunder; if the body be of elongated shape,
and be crossed at more points than one, the forces at work will
tend to exaggerate its foldings, and the tendency to rupture is
greatest when <i>F&#xfeff;<sub>a</sub></i> is in some median position (Fig. <a href="#fig56" title="go to Fig. 56">56</a>).</p>

<div class="dctr06" id="fig56">
<img src="images/i184.png" width="426" height="243" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 56.</div></div>

<p>When the locus <i>F&#xfeff;<sub>a</sub></i> has passed entirely over the body, the body
tends to move towards regions of weaker force; but when, in
turn, the locus <i>F&#xfeff;<sub>b</sub></i> has crossed it, then the body again moves towards
regions of stronger force, that is to say, towards the nearest pole.
And, in thus moving towards the pole, it will do so, as appears
actually to be the case in the dividing cell, along the course of
the outer lines of force, the so-called “mantle-fibres” of the
histologist<a class="afnanch" href="#fn236" id="fnanch236">236</a>.</p>

<p>Such con­si­de­ra­tions as these give general results, easily open
to modification in detail by a change of any of the arbitrary
postulates which have been made for the sake of simplicity.
Doubtless there are many other assumptions which would more
or less meet the case; for instance, that of
Ida H. Hyde that, <span class="xxpn" id="p185">{185}</span>
during the active phase of the chromatin molecule (during which
it decomposes and sets free nucleic acid) it carries a charge opposite
to that which it bears during its resting, or alkaline phase; and
that it would accordingly move towards different poles under the
influence of a current, wandering with its negative charge in an
alkaline fluid during its acid phase to the anode, and to the kathode
during its alkaline phase. A whole field of speculation is opened
up when we begin to consider the cell not merely as a polarised
electrical field, but also as an electrolytic field, full of wandering
ions. Indeed it is high time we reminded ourselves that we have
perhaps been dealing too much with ordinary physical analogies:
and that our whole field of force within the cell is of an order of
magnitude where these grosser analogies may fail to serve us,
and might even play us false, or lead us astray. But our sole
object meanwhile, as I have said more than once, is to demonstrate,
by such illustrations as these, that, whatever be the actual
and as yet unknown <i>modus operandi</i>, there are physical conditions
and distributions of force which <i>could</i> produce just such phenomena
of movement as we see taking place within the living cell.
This, and no more, is precisely what Descartes is said to have
claimed for his description of the human body as a “mechanism<a class="afnanch" href="#fn237" id="fnanch237">237</a>.”</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The foregoing account is based on the provisional assumption
that the phenomena of caryokinesis are analogous to, if not identical
with those of a bipolar electrical field; and this comparison, in
my opinion, offers without doubt the best available series of
analogies. But we must on no account omit to mention the
fact that some of Leduc’s diffusion-experiments offer very remarkable
analogies to the diagrammatic phenomena of caryokinesis, as
shewn in the annexed figure<a class="afnanch" href="#fn238" id="fnanch238">238</a>.
Here we have two identical (not
opposite) poles of osmotic concentration, formed by placing a drop
of indian ink in salt water, and then on either side of this central
drop, a hypertonic drop of salt solution more lightly coloured.
On either side the pigment of the central drop has been drawn
towards the focus nearest to it; but in
the middle line, the pigment <span class="xxpn" id="p186">{186}</span>
is drawn in opposite directions by equal forces, and so tends to
remain undisturbed, in the form of an “equatorial plate.”</p>

<p>Nor should we omit to take account (however briefly and
inadequately) of a novel and elegant hypothesis put forward by
A. B. Lamb. This hypothesis makes use of a theorem of Bjerknes,
to the effect that synchronously vibrating or pulsating bodies in
a liquid field attract or repel one another according as their
oscillations are identical or opposite in phase. Under such
circumstances, true currents, or hydrodynamic lines of force, are
produced, identical in form with the lines of force of a magnetic
field; and other particles floating, though not necessarily pulsating,
in the liquid field, tend to be attracted or repelled by the pulsating
bodies according as they are lighter or heavier than the surrounding
fluid. Moreover (and this is the most remarkable point of all),
the lines of force set up by the <i>oppositely</i> pulsating bodies are the
same as those which are produced by <i>opposite</i> magnetic poles:
though in the former case repulsion, and in the latter case attraction,
takes place between the two poles<a class="afnanch" href="#fn239" id="fnanch239">239</a>.</p>

<p>But to return to our general discussion.</p>

<p>While it can scarcely be too often repeated that our enquiry
is not directed towards the solution of
physiological problems, save <span class="xxpn" id="p187">{187}</span>
only in so far as they are inseparable from the problems presented
by the visible con­fi­gur­a­tions of form and structure, and while we
try, as far as possible, to evade the difficult question of what
particular forces are at work when the mere visible forms produced
are such as to leave this an open question, yet in this particular
case we have been drawn into the use of electrical analogies, and
we are bound to justify, if possible, our resort to this particular
mode of physical action. There is an important paper by R. S. Lillie,
on the “Electrical Convection of certain Free Cells and Nuclei<a class="afnanch" href="#fn240" id="fnanch240">240</a>,”
which, while I cannot quote it in direct support of the suggestions
which I have made, yet gives just the evidence we need in order
to shew that electrical forces act upon the constituents of the
cell, and that their action discriminates between the two species
of colloids represented by the cytoplasm and the nuclear chromatin.
And the difference is such that, in the presence of an electrical
current, the cell substance and the nuclei (including sperm-cells)
tend to migrate, the former on the whole with the positive, the
latter with the negative stream: a difference of electrical potential
being thus indicated between the particle and the surrounding
medium, just as in the case of minute suspended particles of various
kinds in various feebly conducing media<a class="afnanch" href="#fn241" id="fnanch241">241</a>.
And the electrical
difference is doubtless greatest, in the case of the cell constituents,
just at the period of mitosis: when the chromatin is invariably
in its most deeply staining, most strongly acid, and therefore,
presumably, in its most electrically
negative phase. In short, <span class="xxpn" id="p188">{188}</span>
Lillie comes easily to the conclusion that “electrical theories of
mitosis are entitled to more careful consideration than they have
hitherto received.”</p>

<p>Among other investigations, all leading towards the same
general conclusion, namely that differences of electric potential
play a great part in the phenomenon of cell division, I would
mention a very noteworthy paper by Ida H. Hyde<a class="afnanch" href="#fn242" id="fnanch242">242</a>,
in which the
writer shews (among other important observations) that not only
is there a measurable difference of potential between the animal
and vegetative poles of a fertilised egg (<i>Fundulus</i>, toad, turtle,
etc.), but that this difference is not constant, but fluctuates, or
actually reverses its direction, periodically, at epochs coinciding
with successive acts of segmentation or other important phases
in the development of the egg<a class="afnanch" href="#fn243" id="fnanch243">243</a>;
just as other physical rhythms,
for instance in the production of CO&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub>&#x202f;, had already been shewn
to do. Hence we shall be by no means surprised to find that the
“materialised” lines of force, which in the earlier stages form the
convergent curves of the spindle, are replaced in the later phases
of caryokinesis by divergent curves, indicating that the two foci,
which are marked out within the field by the divided and reconstituted
nuclei, are now alike in their polarity (Figs. <a href="#fig58" title="go to Fig. 58">58</a>, 59).</p>

<p>It is certain, to my mind, that these observations of Miss
Hyde’s, and of Lillie’s, taken together with those of many writers
on the behaviour of colloid particles generally in their relation
to an electrical field, have a close bearing upon the physiological
side of our problem, the full discussion of which lies outside our
present field.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The break-up of the nucleus, already referred to and ascribed
to a diminution of its surface-tension, is accompanied by certain
diffusion phenomena which are sometimes visible to the eye; and
we are reminded of Lord Kelvin’s view that
diffusion is implicitly <span class="xxpn" id="p189">{189}</span>
associated with surface-tension changes, of which the first step
is a minute puckering of the surface-skin, a sort of interdigitation
with the surrounding medium. For instance, Schewiakoff
has observed in <i>Euglypha</i><a class="afnanch" href="#fn244" id="fnanch244">244</a>
that, just before the break-up
of the nucleus, a system of rays appears, concentred about it,
but having nothing to do with the polar asters: and during the
existence of this striation, the nucleus enlarges very considerably,
evidently by imbibition of fluid from the surrounding protoplasm.
In short, diffusion is at work, hand in hand with, and as it were
in opposition to, the surface-tensions which define the nucleus.
By diffusion, hand in hand with surface-tension, the alveoli of
the nuclear meshwork are formed, enlarged, and finally ruptured:
diffusion sets up the movements which give rise to the appearance
of rays, or striae, around the nucleus: and through increasing
diffusion, and weakening surface-tension, the rounded outline of
the nucleus finally disappears. <span class="xxpn" id="p190">{190}</span></p>

<p>As we study these manifold phenomena, in the individual cases
of particular plants and animals, we recognise a close identity of
type, coupled with almost endless variation of specific detail;
and in particular, the order of succession in which certain of the
phenomena occur is variable and irregular. The precise order of
the phenomena, the time of longitudinal and of transverse fission
of the chromatin thread, of the break-up of the nuclear wall, and
so forth, will depend upon various minor contingencies and
“interferences.” And it is worthy of particular note that these
variations, in the order of events and in other subordinate details,
while doubtless attributable to specific physical conditions, would
seem to be without any obvious clas­si­fi­ca­tory value or other
biological significance<a class="afnanch" href="#fn246" id="fnanch246">246</a>.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>As regards the actual mechanical division of the cell into two
halves, we shall see presently that, in certain cases, such as that
of a long cylindrical filament, surface-tension, and what is known
as the principle of “minimal area,” go a long way to explain the
mechanical process of division; and in all cells whatsoever, the
process of division must somehow be explained as the result of
a conflict between surface-tension and its opposing forces. But
in such a case as our spherical cell, it is not very easy to see what
physical cause is at work to disturb its equi­lib­rium and its integrity.</p>

<p>The fact that, when actual division of the cell takes place, it
does so at right angles to the polar axis and precisely in the
direction of the equatorial plane, would lead us to suspect that
the new surface formed in the equatorial plane sets up an annular
tension, directed inwards, where it meets the outer surface layer
of the cell itself. But at this point, the problem becomes more
complicated. Before we could hope to comprehend it, we should
have not only to enquire into the potential distribution at the
surface of the cell in relation to that which we have seen to exist
in its interior, but we should probably also have to take account
of the differences of potential which the material arrangements
along the lines of force must themselves
tend to produce. Only <span class="xxpn" id="p191">{191}</span>
thus could we approach a comprehension of the balance of forces
which cohesion, friction, capillarity and electrical distribution
combine to set up.</p>

<p>The manner in which we regard the phenomenon would seem
to turn, in great measure, upon whether or no we are justified in
assuming that, in the liquid surface-film of a minute spherical cell,
local, and symmetrically localised, differences of surface-tension
are likely to occur. If not, then changes in the conformation of
the cell such as lead immediately to its division must be ascribed
not to local changes in its surface-tension, but rather to direct
changes in internal pressure, or to mechanical forces due to an
induced surface-distribution of electrical potential.</p>

<p>It has seemed otherwise to many writers, and we have a number
of theories of cell division which are all based directly on inequalities
or asymmetry of surface-tension. For instance, Bütschli
suggested, some forty years ago<a class="afnanch" href="#fn247" id="fnanch247">247</a>,
that cell division is brought
about by an increase of surface-tension in the equatorial region
of the cell. This explanation, however, can scarcely hold; for
it would seem that such an increase of surface-tension in the
equatorial plane would lead to the cell becoming flattened out into
a disc, with a sharply curved equatorial edge, and to a streaming
of material towards the equator. In 1895, Loeb shewed that the
streaming went on from the equator towards the divided nuclei,
and he supposed that the violence of these streaming movements
brought about actual division of the cell: a hypothesis which was
adopted by many other physiologists<a class="afnanch" href="#fn248" id="fnanch248">248</a>.
This streaming movement
would suggest, as Robertson has pointed out, a <i>diminution</i>
of surface-tension in the region of the equator. Now Quincke has
shewn that the formation of soaps at the surface of an oil-droplet
results in a diminution of the surface-tension of the latter; and
that if the saponification be local, that part of the surface tends to
spread. By laying a thread moistened with a dilute solution of
caustic alkali, or even merely smeared with soap, across a drop
of oil, Robertson has further shewn that the drop at once divides
into two: the edges of the drop, that is to say
the ends of the <span class="xxpn" id="p192">{192}</span>
diameter across which the thread lies, recede from the thread,
so forming a notch at each end of the diameter, while violent
streaming motions are set up at the surface, away from the thread
in the direction of the two opposite poles. Robertson<a class="afnanch" href="#fn249" id="fnanch249">249</a>
suggests,
accordingly, that the division of the cell is actually brought about
by a lowering of the equatorial surface-tension, and that this in
turn is due to a chemical action, such as a liberation of cholin,
or of soaps of cholin, through the splitting of lecithin in nuclear
synthesis.</p>

<p>But purely chemical changes are not of necessity the fundamental
cause of alteration in the surface-tension of the egg, for
the action of electrolytes on surface-tension is now well known
and easily demonstrated. So, according to other views than
those with which we have been dealing, electrical charges are
sufficient in themselves to account for alterations of surface-tension;
while these in turn account for that protoplasmic
streaming which, as so many investigators agree, initiates the
segmentation of the egg<a class="afnanch" href="#fn250" id="fnanch250">250</a>.
A great part of our difficulty arises
from the fact that in such a case as this the various phenomena
are so entangled and apparently concurrent that it is hard to say
which initiates another, and to which this or that secondary
phenomenon may be considered due. Of recent years the phenomenon
of <i>adsorption</i> has been adduced (as we have already briefly
said) in order to account for many of the events and appearances
which are associated with the asymmetry, and lead towards the
division, of the cell. But our short discussion of this phenomenon
may be reserved for another chapter.</p>

<p>However, we are not directly concerned here with the
phenomena of segmentation or cell division in themselves, except
only in so far as visible changes of form are capable of easy and
obvious correlation with the play of force. The very fact of
“development” indicates that, while it lasts, the equi­lib­rium of
the egg is never complete<a class="afnanch" href="#fn251" id="fnanch251">251</a>.
And we may
simply conclude the <span class="xxpn" id="p193">{193}</span>
matter by saying that, if you have caryokinetic figures developing
inside the cell, that of itself indicates that the dynamic system
and the localised forces arising from it are in continual alteration;
and, consequently, changes in the outward configuration of the
system are bound to take place.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>As regards the phenomena of fertilisation,—of the union of
the spermatozoon with the “pronucleus” of the egg,—we might
study these also in illustration, up to a certain point, of the
polarised forces which are manifestly at work. But we shall
merely take, as a single illustration, the paths of the male and
female pronuclei, as they travel to their ultimate meeting place.</p>

<p>The spermatozoon, when within a very short distance of the
egg-cell, is attracted by it. Of the nature of this attractive force
we have no certain knowledge, though we would seem to have
a pregnant hint in Loeb’s discovery that, in the neighbourhood
of other substances, such even as a fragment, or bead, of glass,
the spermatozoon undergoes a similar attraction. But, whatever
the force may be, it is one acting normally to the surface of the
ovum, and accordingly, after entry, the sperm-nucleus points
straight towards the centre of the egg; from the fact that other
spermatozoa, subsequent to the first, fail to effect an entry, we
may safely conclude that an immediate consequence of the entry
of the spermatozoon is an increase in the surface-tension of the
egg<a class="afnanch" href="#fn252" id="fnanch252">252</a>.
Somewhere or other, near or far away, within the egg, lies
its own nuclear body, the so-called female pronucleus, and we
find after a while that this has fused with the head of the spermatozoon
(or male pronucleus), and that the body resulting from
their fusion has come to occupy the centre of the egg. This <i>must</i>
be due (as Whitman pointed out long ago) to a force of attraction
acting between the two bodies, and another force acting upon
one or other or both in the direction of the centre of the cell.
Did we know the magnitude of these several forces, it would be
a very easy task to calculate the precise path which the two
pronuclei would follow, leading to
conjugation and the central <span class="xxpn" id="p194">{194}</span>
position. As we do not know the magnitude, but only the direction,
of these forces we can only make a general statement: (1) the
paths of both moving bodies will lie wholly within a plane triangle
drawn between the two bodies and the centre of the cell; (2) unless
the two bodies happen to lie, to begin with, precisely on a diameter
of the cell, their paths until they meet one another will be curved
paths, the convexity of the curve being towards the straight line
joining the two bodies; (3) the two bodies will meet a little before
they reach the centre; and, having met and fused, will travel
on to reach the centre in a straight line. The actual study and
observation of the path followed is not very easy, owing to the
fact that what we usually see is not the path itself, but only a
<i>projection</i> of the path upon the plane of the microscope; but the
curved path is particularly well seen in the frog’s egg, where the
path of the spermatozoon is marked by a little streak of brown
pigment, and the fact of the meeting of the pronuclei before
reaching the centre has been repeatedly seen by many observers.</p>

<p>The problem is nothing else than a particular case of the
famous problem of three bodies, which has so occupied the
astronomers; and it is obvious that the foregoing brief description
is very far from including all possible cases. Many of these are
particularly described in the works of Fol, Roux, Whitman and
others<a class="afnanch" href="#fn253" id="fnanch253">253</a>.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The intracellular phenomena of which we have now spoken
have assumed immense importance in biological literature and
discussion during the last forty years; but it is open to us to doubt
whether they will be found in the end to possess more than a
remote and secondary biological significance. Most, if not all of
them, would seem to follow immediately and inevitably from very
simple assumptions as to the physical constitution of the cell, and
from an extremely simple distribution of polarised forces within
it. We have already seen that how a thing grows, and what it
grows into, is a dynamic and not a merely material problem; so
far as the material substance is concerned, it
is so only by reason <span class="xxpn" id="p195">{195}</span>
of the chemical, electrical or other forces which are associated
with it. But there is another consideration which would lead us
to suspect that many features in the structure and configuration
of the cell are of very secondary biological importance; and that
is, the great variation to which these phenomena are subject in
similar or closely related organisms, and the apparent impossibility
of correlating them with the peculiarities of the organism as a
whole. “Comparative study has shewn that almost every detail
of the processes (of mitosis) described above is subject to variation
in different forms of cells<a class="afnanch" href="#fn254" id="fnanch254">254</a>.”
A multitude of cells divide to the
accompaniment of caryokinetic phenomena; but others do so
without any visible caryokinesis at all. Sometimes the polarised
field of force is within, sometimes it is adjacent to, and at other
times it lies remote from the nucleus. The distribution of potential
is very often symmetrical and bipolar, as in the case described;
but a less symmetrical distribution often occurs, with the result that
we have, for a time at least, numerous centres of force, instead
of the two main correlated poles: this is the simple explanation
of the numerous stellate figures, or “Strahlungen,” which have
been described in certain eggs, such as those of <i>Chaetopterus</i>. In
one and the same species of worm (<i>Ascaris megalocephala</i>), one
group or two groups of chromosomes may be present. And
remarkably constant, in general, as the number of chromosomes in
any one species undoubtedly is, yet we must not forget that, in
plants and animals alike, the whole range of observed numbers is
but a small one; for (as regards the germ-nuclei) few organisms
have less than six chromosomes, and fewer still have more than
sixteen<a class="afnanch" href="#fn255" id="fnanch255">255</a>.
In closely related animals, such as various species of
Copepods, and even in the same species of worm or insect, the
form of the chromosomes, and their arrangement in relation to
the nuclear spindle, have been found to differ in the various ways
alluded to above. In short, there seem to be strong grounds for
believing that these and many similar phenomena are in no way
specifically related to the particular organism
in which they have <span class="xxpn" id="p196">{196}</span>
been observed, and are not even specially and indisputably connected
with the organism as such. They include such manifestations
of the physical forces, in their various permutations and
combinations, as may also be witnessed, under appropriate
conditions, in non-living things.</p>

<p>When we attempt to separate our purely morphological or
“purely embryological” studies from physiological and physical
investigations, we tend <i>ipso facto</i> to regard each particular structure
and configuration as an attribute, or a particular “character,” of
this or that particular organism. From this assumption we are
apt to go on to the drawing of new conclusions or the framing of
new theories as to the ancestral history, the clas­si­fi­ca­tory position,
the natural affinities of the several organisms: in fact, to apply
our embryological knowledge mainly, and at times exclusively, to
the study of <i>phylogeny</i>. When we find, as we are not long of
finding, that our phylogenetic hypotheses, as drawn from embryology,
become complex and unwieldy, we are nevertheless
reluctant to admit that the whole method, with its fundamental
postulates, is at fault. And yet nothing short of this would
seem to be the case, in regard to the earlier phases at least of
embryonic development. All the evidence at hand goes, as it
seems to me, to shew that embryological data, prior to and even
long after the epoch of segmentation, are essentially a subject for
physiological and physical in­ves­ti­ga­tion and have but the very
slightest link with the problems of systematic or zoological
clas­si­fi­ca­tion. Comparative embryology has its own facts to
classify, and its own methods and principles of clas­si­fi­ca­tion.
Thus we may classify eggs according to the presence or absence,
the paucity or abundance, of their associated food-yolk, the
chromosomes according to their form and their number, the
segmentation according to its various “types,” radial, bilateral,
spiral, and so forth. But we have little right to expect, and in
point of fact we shall very seldom and (as it were) only accidentally
find, that these embryological categories coincide with the lines
of “natural” or “phylogenetic” clas­si­fi­ca­tion which have been
arrived at by the systematic zoologist.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The cell, which Goodsir spoke of as a “centre of
force,” is in <span class="xxpn" id="p197">{197}</span>
reality a “sphere of action” of certain more or less localised
forces; and of these, surface-tension is the particular force which
is especially responsible for giving to the cell its outline and its
morphological individuality. The partially segmented differs from
the totally segmented egg, the unicellular Infusorian from the
minute multicellular Turbellarian, in the intensity and the range of
those surface-tensions which in the one case succeed and in the
other fail to form a visible separation between the “cells.” Adam
Sedgwick used to call attention to the fact that very often, even
in eggs that appear to be totally segmented, it is yet impossible
to discover an actual separation or cleavage, through and through
between the cells which on the surface of the egg are so clearly
delimited; so far and no farther have the physical forces effectuated
a visible “cleavage.” The vacuolation of the protoplasm in
<i>Actinophrys</i> or <i>Actinosphaerium</i> is due to localised surface-tensions,
quite irrespective of the multinuclear nature of the latter
organism. In short, the boundary walls due to surface-tension
may be present or may be absent with or without the delimination
of the other specific fields of force which are usually
correlated with these boundaries and with the independent
individuality of the cells. What we may safely admit, however,
is that one effect of these circumscribed fields of force is usually
such a separation or segregation of the protoplasmic constituents,
the more fluid from the less fluid and so forth, as to give a field
where surface-tension may do its work and bring a visible boundary
into being. When the formation of a “surface” is once effected,
its physical condition, or phase, will be bound to differ notably
from that of the interior of the cell, and under appropriate chemical
conditions the formation of an actual cell-wall, cellulose or other,
is easily intelligible. To this subject we shall return again, in
another chapter.</p>

<p>From the moment that we enter on a dynamical conception
of the cell, we perceive that the old debates were in vain as to
what visible portions of the cell were active or passive, living or
non-living. For the manifestations of force can only be due to
the <i>interaction</i> of the various parts, to the transference of energy
from one to another. Certain properties may be manifested,
certain functions may be carried on, by
the protoplasm apart <span class="xxpn" id="p198">{198}</span>
from the nucleus; but the interaction of the two is necessary,
that other and more important properties or functions may be
manifested. We know, for instance, that portions of an Infusorian
are incapable of regenerating lost parts in the absence of a nucleus,
while nucleated pieces soon regain the specific form of the organism:
and we are told that reproduction by fission cannot be <i>initiated</i>,
though apparently all its later steps can be carried on, independently
of nuclear action. Nor, as Verworn pointed out, can the
nucleus possibly be regarded as the “sole vehicle of inheritance,”
since only in the conjunction of cell and nucleus do we find the
essentials of cell-life. “Kern und Protoplasma sind nur <i>vereint</i>
lebensfähig,” as Nussbaum said. Indeed we may, with E. B.
Wilson, go further, and say that “the terms ‘nucleus’ and ‘cell-body’
should probably be regarded as only topographical expressions
denoting two differentiated areas in a common structural
basis.”</p>

<p>Endless discussion has taken place regarding the centrosome,
some holding that it is a specific and essential structure, a permanent
corpuscle derived from a similar pre-existing corpuscle, a
“fertilising element” in the spermatozoon, a special “organ of
cell-division,” a material “dynamic centre” of the cell (as Van
Beneden and Boveri call it); while on the other hand, it is pointed
out that many cells live and multiply without any visible centrosomes,
that a centrosome may disappear and be created anew,
and even that under artificial conditions abnormal chemical
stimuli may lead to the formation of new centrosomes. We may
safely take it that the centrosome, or the “attraction sphere,”
is essentially a “centre of force,” and that this dynamic centre
may or may not be constituted by (but will be very apt to produce)
a concrete and visible concentration of matter.</p>

<p>It is far from correct to say, as is often done, that the cell-wall,
or cell-membrane, belongs “to the passive products of protoplasm
rather than to the living cell itself”; or to say that in the animal
cell, the cell-wall, because it is “slightly developed,” is relatively
unimportant compared with the important role which it assumes
in plants. On the contrary, it is quite certain that, whether
visibly differentiated into a semi-permeable membrane, or merely
constituted by a liquid film, the surface of the cell is
the seat of <span class="xxpn" id="p199">{199}</span>
important forces, capillary and electrical, which play an essential
part in the dynamics of the cell. Even in the thickened, largely
solidified cellulose wall of the plant-cell, apart from the mechanical
resistances which it affords, the osmotic forces developed in connection
with it are of essential importance.</p>

<p>But if the cell acts, after this fashion, as a whole, each part
interacting of necessity with the rest, the same is certainly true
of the entire multicellular organism: as Schwann said of old, in
very precise and adequate words, “the whole organism subsists
only by means of the <i>reciprocal action</i> of the single elementary
parts<a class="afnanch" href="#fn256" id="fnanch256">256</a>.”</p>

<p>As Wilson says again, “the physiological autonomy of the
individual cell falls into the background&#x200a;...&#x200a;and the apparently
composite character which the multicellular organism may exhibit
is owing to a secondary distribution of its energies among local
centres of action<a class="afnanch" href="#fn257" id="fnanch257">257</a>.”</p>

<p>It is here that the homology breaks down which is so often
drawn, and overdrawn, between the unicellular organism and the
individual cell of the metazoon<a class="afnanch" href="#fn258" id="fnanch258">258</a>.</p>

<p>Whitman, Adam Sedgwick<a class="afnanch" href="#fn259" id="fnanch259">259</a>,
and others have lost no
opportunity of warning us against a too literal acceptation
of the cell-theory, against the view that the multicellular
organism is a colony (or, as Haeckel called it (in the case
of the plant), a “republic”) of independent units of life<a class="afnanch" href="#fn260" id="fnanch260">260</a>.
As Goethe said long ago, “Das lebendige
ist zwar in Elemente <span class="xxpn" id="p200">{200}</span>
zerlegt, aber man kann es aus diesen nicht wieder zusammenstellen
und beleben;” the dictum of the <i>Cellularpathologie</i> being just
the opposite, “Jedes Thier erscheint als eine Summe vitaler
Einheiten, von denen <i>jede den vollen Charakter des Lebens an
sich trägt</i>.”</p>

<p>Hofmeister and Sachs have taught us that in the plant the
growth of the mass, the growth of the organ, is the primary fact,
that “cell formation is a phenomenon very general in organic
life, but still only of secondary significance.” “Comparative
embryology” says Whitman, “reminds us at every turn that the
organism dominates cell-formation, using for the same purpose
one, several, or many cells, massing its material and directing its
movements and shaping its organs, as if cells did not exist<a class="afnanch" href="#fn261" id="fnanch261">261</a>.”
So Rauber declared that, in the whole world of organisms, “das
Ganze liefert die Theile, nicht die Theile das Ganze: letzteres
setzt die Theile zusammen, nicht diese jenes<a class="afnanch" href="#fn262" id="fnanch262">262</a>.”
And on the
botanical side De Bary has summed up the matter in an aphorism,
“Die Pflanze bildet Zellen, nicht die Zelle bildet Pflanzen.”</p>

<p>Discussed almost wholly from the concrete, or morphological
point of view, the question has for the most part been made to turn
on whether actual protoplasmic continuity can be demonstrated
between one cell and another, whether the organism be an actual
reticulum, or syncytium. But from the dynamical point of view
the question is much simpler. We then deal not with material
continuity, not with little bridges of connecting protoplasm, but
with a continuity of forces, a comprehensive field of force, which
runs through and through the entire organism and is by no means
restricted in its passage to a protoplasmic continuum. And such
a continuous field of force, somehow shaping the whole organism,
independently of the number, magnitude and form of the individual
cells, which enter, like a froth, into its fabric, seems to me certainly
and obviously to exist. As Whitman says, “the fact that physiological
unity is not broken by cell-boundaries is confirmed in so
many ways that it must be accepted as one of the fundamental
truths of biology<a class="afnanch" href="#fn263" id="fnanch263">263</a>.”</p>

<div class="chapter" id="p201">
<h2 class="h2herein" title="V. The Forms of Cells">CHAPTER V
<span class="h2ttl">
THE FORMS OF CELLS</span></h2></div>

<p>Protoplasm, as we have already said, is a fluid or rather a
semifluid substance, and we need not pause here to attempt to
describe the particular properties of the semifluid, colloid, or
jelly-like substances to which it is allied; we should find it no
easy matter. Nor need we appeal to precise theoretical definitions
of fluidity, lest we come into a debateable land. It is in the most
general sense that protoplasm is “fluid.” As Graham said (of
colloid matter in general), “its softness <i>partakes of fluidity</i>, and
enables the colloid to become a vehicle for liquid diffusion, like
water itself<a class="afnanch" href="#fn264" id="fnanch264">264</a>.”
When we can deal with protoplasm in sufficient
quantity we see it flow; particles move freely through it, air-bubbles
and liquid droplets shew round or spherical within it;
and we shall have much to say about other phenomena manifested
by its own surface, which are those especially char­ac­ter­is­tic of
liquids. It may encompass and contain solid bodies, and it may
“secrete” within or around itself solid substances; and very
often in the complex living organism these solid substances
formed by the living protoplasm, like shell or nail or horn or
feather, may remain when the protoplasm which formed them
is dead and gone; but the protoplasm itself is fluid or semifluid,
and accordingly permits of free (though not necessarily rapid)
<i>diffusion</i> and easy <i>convection</i> of particles within itself. This simple
fact is of elementary importance in connection with form, and
with what appear at first sight to be common char­ac­teris­tics or
peculiarities of the forms of living things.</p>

<p>The older naturalists, in discussing the differences between
inorganic and organic bodies, laid stress upon the fact or statement
that the former grow by “agglutination,”
and the latter by <span class="xxpn" id="p202">{202}</span>
what they termed “intussusception.” The contrast is true,
rather, of solid as compared with jelly-like bodies of all kinds,
living or dead, the great majority of which as it so happens, but
by no means all, are of organic origin.</p>

<p>A crystal “grows” by deposition of new molecules, one by
one and layer by layer, superimposed or aggregated upon the
solid substratum already formed. Each particle would seem to
be influenced, practically speaking, only by the particles in its
immediate neighbourhood, and to be in a state of freedom and
independence from the influence, either direct or indirect, of its
remoter neighbours. As Lord Kelvin and others have explained
the formation and the resulting forms of crystals, so we believe
that each added particle takes up its position in relation to its
immediate neighbours already arranged, generally in the holes and
corners that their arrangement leaves, and in closest contact with
the greatest number<a class="afnanch" href="#fn265" id="fnanch265">265</a>.
And hence we may repeat or imitate this
process of arrangement, with great or apparently even with
precise accuracy (in the case of the simpler crystalline systems),
by piling up spherical pills or grains of shot. In so doing, we must
have regard to the fact that each particle must drop into the
place where it can go most easily, or where no easier place offers.
In more technical language, each particle is free to take up, and
does take up, its position of least potential energy relative to those
already deposited; in other words, for each particle motion is
induced until the energy of the system is so distributed that no
tendency or resultant force remains to move it more. The
application of this principle has been shewn to lead to the production
of <i>planes</i><a class="afnanch" href="#fn266" id="fnanch266">266</a>
(in all cases where by the limitation of material,
surfaces <i>must</i> occur); and where we have planes, straight edges
and solid angles must obviously also occur;
and, if equi­lib­rium is <span class="xxpn" id="p203">{203}</span>
to follow, must occur symmetrically. Our piling up of shot, or
manufacture of mimic crystals, gives us visible demonstration
that the result is actually to obtain, as in the natural crystal,
plane surfaces and sharp angles, symmetrically disposed.</p>

<p>But the living cell grows in a totally different way, very much
as a piece of glue swells up in water, by “imbibition,” or by interpenetration
into and throughout its entire substance. The semifluid
colloid mass takes up water, partly to combine chemically
with its individual molecules<a class="afnanch" href="#fn267" id="fnanch267">267</a>,
partly by physical diffusion into
the interstices between these molecules, and partly, as it would
seem, in other ways; so that the entire phenomenon is a very
complex and even an obscure one. But, so far as we are concerned,
the net result is a very simple one. For the equi­lib­rium or
tendency to equi­lib­rium of fluid pressure in all parts of its interior
while the process of imbibition is going on, the constant rearrangement
of its fluid mass, the contrast in short with the crystalline
method of growth where each particle comes to rest to move
(relatively to the whole) no more, lead the mass of jelly to swell
up, very much as a bladder into which we blow air, and so, by
a <i>graded</i> and harmonious distribution of forces, to assume everywhere
a rounded and more or less bubble-like external form<a class="afnanch" href="#fn268" id="fnanch268">268</a>.
So, when the same school of older naturalists called attention to
a new distinction or contrast of form between the organic and
inorganic objects, in that the contours of the former tended to
roundness and curvature, and those of the latter to be bounded
by straight lines, planes and sharp angles, we see that this contrast
was not a new and different one, but only another aspect of
their former statement, and an immediate consequence of the
difference between the processes of agglutination and intussusception.</p>

<p>This common and general contrast between the form of the
crystal on the one hand, and of the colloid or of the organism on
the other, must by no means be pressed
too far. For Lehmann, <span class="xxpn" id="p204">{204}</span>
in his great work on so-called Fluid Crystals<a class="afnanch" href="#fn269" id="fnanch269">269</a>,
to which we shall
afterwards return, has shewn how, under certain circumstances,
surface-tension phenomena may coexist with cry­stal­li­sa­tion, and
produce a form of minimal potential which is a resultant of both:
the fact being that the bonds maintaining the crystalline arrangement
are now so much looser than in the solid condition that the
tendency to least total surface-area is capable of being satisfied.
Thus the phenomenon of “liquid cry­stal­li­sa­tion” does not destroy
the distinction between crystalline and colloidal forms, but gives
added unity and continuity to the whole series of phenomena<a class="afnanch" href="#fn270" id="fnanch270">270</a>.
Lehmann has also demonstrated phenomena within the crystal,
known for instance as transcry­stal­li­sa­tion, which shew us that we
must not speak unguardedly of the growth of crystals as limited
to deposition upon a surface, and Bütschli has already pointed out
the possible great importance to the biologist of the various
phenomena which Lehmann has described<a class="afnanch" href="#fn271" id="fnanch271">271</a>.</p>

<p>So far then, as growth goes on, unaffected by pressure or other
external force, the fluidity of protoplasm, its mobility internal
and external, and the manner in which particles move with
comparative freedom from place to place within, all manifestly
tend to the production of swelling, rounded surfaces, and to their
great predominance over plane surfaces in the contour of the
organism. These rounded contours will tend to be preserved, for
a while, in the case of naked protoplasm by its viscosity, and in
the presence of a cell-wall by its very lack of fluidity. In a general
way, the presence of curved boundary surfaces will be especially
obvious in the unicellular organisms, and still more generally in
the <i>external</i> forms of all organisms; and wherever mutual pressure
between adjacent cells, or other adjacent parts, has not come into
play to flatten the rounded surfaces into planes.</p>

<p>But the rounded contours that are
assumed and exhibited by <span class="xxpn" id="p205">{205}</span>
a piece of hard glue, when we throw it into water and see it expand
as it sucks the water up, are not nearly so regular or so beautiful
as are those which appear when we blow a bubble, or form a
drop, or pour water into a more or less elastic bag. For these
curving contours depend upon the properties of the bag itself,
of the film or membrane that contains the mobile gas, or that
contains or bounds the mobile liquid mass. And hereby, in the
case of the fluid or semifluid mass, we are introduced to the
subject of <i>surface tension</i>: of which indeed we have spoken in
the preceding chapter, but which we must now examine with

<p>Among the forces which determine the forms of cells, whether
they be solitary or arranged in contact with one another, this
force of surface-tension is certainly of great, and is probably of
paramount importance. But while we shall try to separate out
the phenomena which are directly due to it, we must not forget
that, in each particular case, the actual conformation which we
study may be, and usually is, the more or less complex resultant
of surface tension acting together with gravity, mechanical
pressure, osmosis, or other physical forces.</p>

<p>Surface tension is that force by which we explain the form of
a drop or of a bubble, of the surfaces external and internal of
a “froth” or collocation of bubbles, and of many other things of
like nature and in like circumstances<a class="afnanch" href="#fn272" id="fnanch272">272</a>.
It is a property of liquids
(in the sense at least with which our subject is concerned), and it
is manifested at or very near the surface, where the liquid comes
into contact with another liquid, a solid or a gas. We note here
that the term <i>surface</i> is to be interpreted in a wide sense; for
wherever we have solid particles imbedded in a fluid, wherever
we have a non-homogeneous fluid or semi-fluid
such as a particle <span class="xxpn" id="p206">{206}</span>
of protoplasm, wherever we have the presence of “impurities,” as
in a mass of molten metal, there we have always to bear in mind
the existence of “surfaces” and of surface tensions, not only
on the exterior of the mass but also throughout its interstices,
wherever like meets unlike.</p>

<p>Surface tension is due to molecular force, to force that is to
say arising from the action of one molecule upon another, and it
is accordingly exerted throughout a small thickness of material,
comparable to the range of the molecular forces. We imagine
that within the interior of the liquid mass such molecular interactions
negative one another: but that at and near the free
surface, within a layer or film ap­prox­i­mate­ly equal to the range
of the molecular force, there must be a lack of such equi­lib­rium
and consequently a manifestation of force.</p>

<p>The action of the molecular forces has been variously explained.
But one simple explanation (or mode of statement) is that the
molecules of the surface layer (whose thickness is definite and
constant) are being constantly attracted into the interior by those
which are more deeply situated, and that consequently, as
molecules keep quitting the surface for the interior, the bulk of
the latter increases while the surface diminishes; and the process
continues till the surface itself has become a minimum, the <i>surface-shrinkage</i>
exhibiting itself as a <i>surface-tension</i>. This is a sufficient
description of the phenomenon in cases where a portion of liquid
is subject to no other than <i>its own molecular forces</i>, and (since the
sphere has, of all solids, the smallest surface for a given volume)
it accounts for the spherical form of the raindrop, of the grain
of shot, or of the living cell in many simple organisms. It accounts
also, as we shall presently see, for a great number of much more
complicated forms, manifested under less simple conditions.</p>

<p>Let us here briefly note that surface tension is, in itself, a
comparatively small force, and easily measurable: for instance
that of water is equivalent to but a few grains per linear inch,
or a few grammes per metre. But this small tension, when it
exists in a <i>curved</i> surface of very great curvature, gives rise to a
very great pressure directed towards the centre of curvature. We
can easily calculate this pressure, and so satisfy ourselves that,
when the radius of curvature is of
molecular dimensions, the <span class="xxpn" id="p207">{207}</span>
pressure is of the magnitude of thousands of atmospheres,—a conclusion
which is supported by other physical con­si­de­ra­tions.</p>

<p>The contraction of a liquid surface and other phenomena of
surface tension involve the doing of work, and the power to do
work is what we call energy. It is obvious, in such a simple case
as we have just considered, that the whole energy of the system
is diffused throughout its molecules; but of this whole stock of
energy it is only that part which comes into play at or very near
to the surface which normally manifests itself in work, and hence
we may speak (though the term is open to some objections) of
a specific <i>surface energy</i>. The consideration of surface energy,
and of the manner in which its amount is increased and multiplied
by the multiplication of surfaces due to the subdivision of the
organism into cells, is of the highest importance to the physiologist;
and even the morphologist cannot wholly pass it by, if he desires
to study the form of the cell in its relation to the phenomena of
surface tension or “capillarity.” The case has been set forth with
the utmost possible lucidity by Tait and by Clerk Maxwell, on
whose teaching the following paragraphs are based: they having
based their teaching upon that of Gauss,—who rested on Laplace.</p>

<p>Let <i>E</i> be the whole potential energy of a mass <i>M</i> of liquid;
let <i>e</i>&#xfeff;<sub>0</sub> be the energy per unit mass of the interior liquid (we may
call it the <i>internal energy</i>); and let <i>e</i> be the energy per unit mass
for a layer of the skin, of surface <i>S</i>, of thickness <i>t</i>, and density
ρ (<i>e</i> being what we call the <i>surface energy</i>). It is obvious that the
total energy consists of the internal <i>plus</i> the surface energy, and
that the former is distributed through the whole mass, minus its
surface layers. That is to say, in math­e­mat­i­cal language,</p>

<div class="dmaths">
<div><i>E</i>
=&#x202f;(<i>M</i>&#x202f;−&#x202f;<i>S</i>&#x202f;·&#x202f;Σ&#x200a;<i>t</i>&#x200a;ρ)&#x200a;<i>e</i>&#xfeff;<sub>0</sub>&#x202f;+&#x202f;<i>S</i>&#x202f;·&#x202f;Σ&#x200a;<i>t</i>&#x200a;ρ&#x200a;<i>e</i>&#x202f;.
</div>

<p class="pcontinue">But this is equivalent to writing:</p>

<div>=&#x202f;<i>M&#x200a;e</i>&#xfeff;<sub>0</sub>&#x202f;+&#x202f;<i>S</i>&#x202f;·&#x202f;Σ&#x200a;<i>t</i>&#x200a;ρ(<i>e</i>&#x202f;−&#x202f;<i>e</i>&#xfeff;<sub>0</sub>)&#x202f;;
</div></div><!--dmaths-->

<p class="pcontinue">and this is as much as to say that the total energy of the system
may be taken to consist of two portions, one uniform throughout
the whole mass, and another, which is proportional on the one hand
to the amount of surface, and on the other hand is proportional
to the difference between <i>e</i> and <i>e</i>&#xfeff;<sub>0</sub>&#x202f;, that is to say to the difference
between the unit values of the internal and
the surface energy. <span class="xxpn" id="p208">{208}</span></p>

<p>It was Gauss who first shewed after this fashion how, from
the mutual attractions between all the particles, we are led to an
expression which is what we now call the <i>potential energy</i> of the
system; and we know, as a fundamental theorem of dynamics,
that the potential energy of the system tends to a minimum, and
in that minimum finds, as a matter of course, its stable equi­lib­rium.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>We see in our last equation that the term <span class="nowrap">
<i>M&#x200a;e</i>&#xfeff;<sub>0</sub></span> is irreducible,
save by a reduction of the mass itself. But the other term may
be diminished (1) by a reduction in the area of surface, <i>S</i>, or
(2) by a tendency towards equality of <i>e</i> and <i>e</i>&#xfeff;<sub>0</sub>&#x202f;, that is to say by
a diminution of the specific surface energy, <i>e</i>.</p>

<p>These then are the two methods by which the energy of the
system will manifest itself in work. The one, which is much the
more important for our purposes, leads always to a diminution of
surface, to the so-called “principle of minimal areas”; the other,
which leads to the lowering (under certain circumstances) of
surface tension, is the basis of the theory of Adsorption, to which
we shall have some occasion to refer as the <i>modus operandi</i> in the
development of a cell-wall, and in a variety of other histological
phenomena. In the technical phraseology of the day, the
“capacity factor” is involved in the one case, and the “intensity
factor” in the other.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as we are concerned with the form of the cell it is
the former which becomes our main postulate: telling us that
the energy equations of the surface of a cell, or of the free surfaces
of cells partly in contact, or of the partition-surfaces of cells in
contact with one another or with an adjacent solid, all indicate
a minimum of potential energy in the system, by which the system
is brought, <i>ipso facto</i>, into equi­lib­rium. And we shall not fail to
observe, with something more than mere historical interest and
curiosity, how deeply and intrinsically there enter into this whole
class of problems the “principle of least action” of Maupertuis,
the “<i>lineae curvae maximi minimive proprietate gaudentes</i>” of
Euler, by which principles these old natural philosophers explained
correctly a multitude of phenomena, and drew the lines whereon
the foundations of great part of modern physics are well and
truly laid. <span class="xxpn" id="p209">{209}</span></p>

<p>In all cases where the principle of maxima and minima comes
into play, as it conspicuously does in the systems of liquid films
which are governed by the laws of surface-tension, the figures and
conformations produced are characterised by obvious and remarkable
<i>symmetry</i>. Such symmetry is in a high degree char­ac­ter­is­tic
of organic forms, and is rarely absent in living things,—save in such
cases as amoeba, where the equi­lib­rium on which symmetry depends
is likewise lacking. And if we ask what physical equi­lib­rium has
to do with formal symmetry and regularity, the reason is not far
to seek; nor can it be put better than in the following words of
Mach’s<a class="afnanch" href="#fn273" id="fnanch273">273</a>.
“In every symmetrical system every deformation that
tends to destroy the symmetry is complemented by an equal and
opposite deformation that tends to restore it. In each deformation
positive and negative work is done. One condition, therefore,
though not an absolutely sufficient one, that a maximum or
minimum of work corresponds to the form of equi­lib­rium, is thus
supplied by symmetry. Regularity is successive symmetry.
There is no reason, therefore, to be astonished that the forms of
equi­lib­rium are often symmetrical and regular.”</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>As we proceed in our enquiry, and especially when we approach
the subject of <i>tissues</i>, or agglomerations of cells, we shall have
from time to time to call in the help of elementary mathematics.
But already, with very little math­e­mat­i­cal help, we find ourselves
in a position to deal with some simple examples of organic forms.</p>

<p>When we melt a stick of sealing-wax in the flame, surface
tension (which was ineffectively present in the solid but finds play
in the now fluid mass), rounds off its sharp edges into curves, so
striving towards a surface of minimal area; and in like manner,
by melting the tip of a thin rod of glass, Leeuwenhoek made the
little spherical beads which served him for a microscope<a class="afnanch" href="#fn274" id="fnanch274">274</a>.
When
any drop of protoplasm, either over all its surface or at some free
end, as at the extremity of the pseudopodium
of an amoeba, is <span class="xxpn" id="p210">{210}</span>
seen likewise to “round itself off,” that is not an effect of “vital
contractility,” but (as Hofmeister shewed so long ago as 1867)
a simple consequence of surface tension; and almost immediately
afterwards Engelmann<a class="afnanch" href="#fn275" id="fnanch275">275</a>
argued on the same lines, that the forces
which cause the contraction of protoplasm in general may “be
just the same as those which tend to make every non-spherical
drop of fluid become spherical!” We are not concerned here with
the many theories and speculations which would connect the
phenomena of surface tension with contractility, muscular movement
or other special <i>physiological</i> functions, but we find ample
room to trace the operation of the same cause in producing, under
conditions of rest and equi­lib­rium, certain definite and inevitable
forms of surface.</p>

<p>It is however of great importance to observe that the living
cell is one of those cases where the phenomena of surface tension
are by no means limited to the <i>outer</i> surface; for within the
heterogeneous substance of the cell, between the protoplasm and
its nuclear and other contents, and in the alveolar network of the
cytoplasm itself (so far as that “alveolar structure” is actually
present in life), we have a multitude of interior surfaces; and,
especially among plants, we may have a large inner surface of
“interfacial” contact, where the protoplasm contains cavities
or “vacuoles” filled with a different and more fluid material, the
“cell-sap.” Here we have a great field for the development of
surface tension phenomena: and so long ago as 1865, Nägeli and
Schwendener shewed that the streaming currents of plant cells
might be very plausibly explained by this phenomenon. Even
ten years earlier, Weber had remarked upon the resemblance
between these protoplasmic streamings and the streamings to be
observed in certain inanimate drops, for which no cause but
surface tension could be assigned<a class="afnanch" href="#fn276" id="fnanch276">276</a>.</p>

<p>The case of amoeba, though it is an elementary case, is at the
same time a complicated one. While it remains “amoeboid,” it
is never at rest or in equi­lib­rium; it is always moving, from one
to another of its protean changes of configuration; its surface
tension is constantly varying from point
to point. Where the <span class="xxpn" id="p211">{211}</span>
surface tension is greater, that portion of the surface will contract
into spherical or spheroidal forms; where it is less the surface
will correspondingly extend. While generally speaking the surface
energy has a minimal value, it is not necessarily constant. It may
be diminished by a rise of temperature; it may be altered by
contact with adjacent substances<a class="afnanch" href="#fn277" id="fnanch277">277</a>,
by the transport of constituent
materials from the interior to the surface, or again by actual
chemical and fermentative change. Within the cell, the surface
energies developed about its heterogeneous contents will constantly
vary as these contents are affected by chemical metabolism. As
the colloid materials are broken down and as the particles in
suspension are diminished in size the “free surface energy”
will be increased, but the osmotic energy will be diminished<a class="afnanch" href="#fn278" id="fnanch278">278</a>.
Thus arise the various fluctuations of surface tension and the
various phenomena of amoeboid form and motion, which Bütschli
and others have reproduced or imitated by means of the fine
emulsions which constitute their “artificial amoebae.” A multitude
of experiments shew how extraordinarily delicate is the
adjustment of the surface tension forces, and how sensitive they
are to the least change of temperature or chemical state. Thus,
on a plate which we have warmed at one side, a drop of alcohol
runs towards the warm area, a drop of oil away from it; and a
drop of water on the glass plate exhibits
lively movements when <span class="xxpn" id="p212">{212}</span>
we bring into its neighbourhood a heated wire, or a glass rod
dipped in ether. When we find that a plasmodium of Aethalium,
for instance, creeps towards a damp spot, or towards a warm spot,
or towards substances that happen to be nutritious, and again
creeps away from solutions of sugar or of salt, we seem to be
dealing with phenomena every one of which can be paralleled by
ordinary phenomena of surface tension<a class="afnanch" href="#fn279" id="fnanch279">279</a>.
Even the soap-bubble
itself is imperfectly in equi­lib­rium, for the reason that its film,
like the protoplasm of amoeba or Aethalium, is an excessively
heterogeneous substance. Its surface tensions vary from point
to point, and chemical changes and changes of temperature
increase and magnify the variation. The whole surface of the
bubble is in constant movement as the concentrated portions of
the soapy fluid make their way outwards from the deeper layers;
it thins and it thickens, its colours change, currents are set up in
it, and little bubbles glide over it; it continues in this state of
constant movement, as its parts strive one with another in all
their interactions towards equi­lib­rium<a class="afnanch" href="#fn280" id="fnanch280">280</a>.</p>

<p>In the case of the naked protoplasmic cell, as the amoeboid
phase is emphatically a phase of freedom and activity, of chemical
and physiological change, so, on the other hand, is the spherical
form indicative of a phase of rest or comparative inactivity. In
the one phase we see unequal surface tensions manifested in the
creeping movements of the amoeboid body, in the rounding off
of the ends of the pseudopodia, in the flowing out of its substance
over a particle of “food,” and in the current-motions in the interior
of its mass; till finally, in the other phase, when internal homogeneity
and equi­lib­rium have been attained
and the potential <span class="xxpn" id="p213">{213}</span>
energy of the system is for the time being at a minimum, the
cell assumes a rounded or spherical form, passing into a state
of “rest,” and (for a reason which we shall presently see)
becoming at the same time “encysted.”</p>

<div class="dright dwth-h" id="fig60">
<img src="images/i213.png" width="200" height="216" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 60.</div></div>

<p>In a budding yeast-cell (Fig. <a href="#fig60" title="go to Fig. 60">60</a>), we see a more definite and
restricted change of surface tension. When a “bud” appears,
whether with or without actual growth by osmosis
or otherwise of the mass, it does so because at a
certain part of the cell-surface the surface tension
has more or less suddenly diminished, and the
area of that portion expands accordingly; but in
turn the surface tension of the expanded area will
make itself felt, and the bud will be rounded off
into a more or less spherical form.</p>

<p>The yeast-cell with its bud is a simple example of a principle
which we shall find to be very important. Our whole treatment
of cell-form in relation to surface-tension depends on the fact
(which Errera was the first to point out, or to give clear expression
to) that the <i>incipient</i> cell-wall retains with but little impairment
the properties of a liquid film<a class="afnanch" href="#fn281" id="fnanch281">281</a>,
and that the growing cell, in spite
of the membrane by which it has already begun to be surrounded,
behaves very much like a fluid drop. But even the ordinary
yeast-cell shows, by its ovoid and non-spherical form, that it has
acquired its shape under the influence of some force other than
that uniform and symmetrical surface-tension which would be
productive of a sphere; and this or any other asymmetrical form,
once acquired, may be retained by virtue of the solidification and
consequent rigidity of the membranous wall of the cell. Unless
such rigidity ensue, it is plain that such a conformation as that of
the cell with its attached bud could not be long retained, amidst
the constantly varying conditions, as a figure of even partial
equi­lib­rium. But as a matter of fact, the cell in this case is not
in equi­lib­rium at all; it is in <i>process</i> of budding, and is slowly
altering its shape by rounding off the bud. It is plain that over
its surface the surface-energies are unequally distributed, owing
to some heterogeneity of the substance; and to this matter we
shall afterwards return. In like manner the
developing egg <span class="xxpn" id="p214">{214}</span>
through all its successive phases of form is never in complete
equi­lib­rium; but is merely responding to constantly changing
conditions, by phases of partial, transitory, unstable and conditional
equi­lib­rium.</p>

<p>It is obvious that there are innumerable solitary plant-cells,
and unicellular organisms in general, which, like the yeast-cell, do
not correspond to any of the simple forms that may be generated
under the influence of simple and homogeneous surface-tension;
and in many cases these forms, which we should expect to be
unstable and transitory, have become fixed and stable by reason
of the comparatively sudden or rapid solidification of the envelope.
This is the case, for instance, in many of the more complicated forms
of diatoms or of desmids, where we are dealing, in a less striking
but even more curious way than in the budding yeast-cell, not
with one simple act of formation, but with a complicated result
of successive stages of localised growth, interrupted by phases of
partial consolidation. The original cell has acquired or assumed
a certain form, and then, under altering conditions and new
distributions of energy, has thickened here or weakened there,
and has grown out or tended (as it were) to branch, at particular
points. We can often, or indeed generally, trace in each particular
stage of growth or at each particular temporary growing point,
the laws of surface tension manifesting themselves in what is
for the time being a fluid surface; nay more, even in the adult
and completed structure, we have little difficulty in tracing and
recognising (for instance in the outline of such a desmid as Euastrum)
the rounded lobes that have successively grown or flowed
out from the original rounded and flattened cell. What we see in
a many chambered foraminifer, such as Globigerina or Rotalia, is
just the same thing, save that it is carried out in greater completeness
and perfection. The little organism as a whole is not a figure
of equi­lib­rium or of minimal area; but each new bud or separate
chamber is such a figure, conditioned by the forces of surface
tension, and superposed upon the complex aggregate of similar
bubbles after these latter have become consolidated one by one
into a rigid system.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Let us now make some enquiry regarding
the various forms <span class="xxpn" id="p215">{215}</span>
which, under the influence of surface tension, a surface can possibly
assume. In doing so, we are obviously limited to conditions
under which other forces are relatively unimportant, that is to
say where the “surface energy” is a considerable fraction of
the whole energy of the system; and this in general will be
the case when we are dealing with portions of liquid so small
that their dimensions come within what we have called the
molecular range, or, more generally, in which the “specific
surface” is large<a class="afnanch" href="#fn282" id="fnanch282">282</a>:
in other words it will be small or minute
organisms, or the small cellular elements of larger organisms,
whose forms will be governed by surface-tension; while the
general forms of the larger organisms will be due to other and
non-molecular forces. For instance, a large surface of water sets
itself level because here gravity is predominant; but the surface
of water in a narrow tube is manifestly curved, for the reason
that we are here dealing with particles which are mutually within
the range of each other’s molecular forces. The same is the case
with the cell-surfaces and cell-partitions which we are presently
to study, and the effect of gravity will be especially counteracted
and concealed when, as in the case of protoplasm in a watery
fluid, the object is immersed in a liquid of nearly its own specific
gravity.</p>

<p>We have already learned, as a fundamental law of surface-tension
phenomena, that a liquid film <i>in equi­lib­rium</i> assumes a
form which gives it a minimal area under the conditions to which
it is subject. And these conditions include (1) the form of the
boundary, if such exist, and (2) the pressure, if any, to which the
film is subject; which pressure is closely related to the volume,
of air or of liquid, which the film (if it be a closed one) may have
to contain. In the simplest of cases, when we take up a soap-film
on a plane wire ring, the film is exposed to equal atmospheric
pressure on both sides, and it obviously has its minimal area in
the form of a plane. So long as our wire ring lies in one plane
(however irregular in outline), the film stretched across it will
still be in a plane; but if we bend the ring so that it lies no longer
in a plane, then our film will become curved into a surface which
may be extremely complicated, but is still
the smallest possible <span class="xxpn" id="p216">{216}</span>
surface which can be drawn continuously across the uneven
boundary.</p>

<p>The question of pressure involves not only external pressures
acting on the film, but also that which the film itself is capable
of exerting. For we have seen that the film is always contracting
to its smallest limits; and when the film is curved, this obviously
leads to a pressure directed inwards,—perpendicular, that is to
say, to the surface of the film. In the case of the soap-bubble,
the uniform contraction of whose surface has led to its spherical
form, this pressure is balanced by the pressure of the air within;
and if an outlet be given for this air, then the bubble contracts
with perceptible force until it stretches across the mouth of the
tube, for instance the mouth of the pipe through which we have
blown the bubble. A precisely similar pressure, directed inwards,
is exercised by the surface layer of a drop of water or a globule
of mercury, or by the surface pellicle on a portion or “drop” of
protoplasm. Only we must always remember that in the soap-bubble,
or the bubble which a glass-blower blows, there is a twofold
pressure as compared with that which the surface-film exercises
on the drop of liquid of which it is a part; for the bubble consists
(unless it be so thin as to consist of a mere layer of molecules<a class="afnanch" href="#fn283" id="fnanch283">283</a>)
of a liquid layer, with a free surface within and another without,
and each of these two surfaces exercises its own independent and
coequal tension, and cor­re­spon­ding pressure<a class="afnanch" href="#fn284" id="fnanch284">284</a>.</p>

<p>If we stretch a tape upon a flat table, whatever be the tension
of the tape it obviously exercises no pressure upon the table
below. But if we stretch it over a <i>curved</i> surface, a cylinder for
instance, it does exercise a downward pressure; and the more
curved the surface the greater is this pressure, that is to say the
greater is this share of the entire force of tension which is resolved
in the downward direction. In math­e­mat­i­cal language, the
pressure (<i>p</i>) varies directly as the tension (<i>T</i>), and inversely as
the radius of curvature (<i>R</i>): that is to say, <i>p</i>
=&#x202f;<i>T&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;R</i>, per unit of
surface. <span class="xxpn" id="p217">{217}</span></p>

<p>If instead of a cylinder, which is curved only in one
direction, we take a case where there are curvatures in two
dimensions (as for instance a sphere), then the effects of
these must be simply added to one another, and the resulting
pressure <i>p</i> is equal to <i>T&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;R</i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;<i>T&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;R&#xfeff;′</i>
or <i>p</i>
=&#x202f;<i>T</i>(1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>R</i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>R&#xfeff;′</i>)<a
class="afnanch" href="#fn285" id="fnanch285" title="go to note
285">&#x2a;</a>.</p>

<p>And if in addition to the pressure <i>p</i>, which is due to surface
tension, we have to take into account other pressures, <i>p&#xfeff;′</i>, <i>p&#xfeff;″</i>, etc.,
which are due to gravity or other forces, then we may say that
the <i>total pressure</i>, <i>P</i>
=&#x202f;<i>p&#xfeff;′</i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;<i>p&#xfeff;″</i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;<i>T</i>(1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>R</i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>R&#xfeff;′</i>). While in some
cases, for instance in speaking of the shape of a bird’s egg, we
shall have to take account of these extraneous pressures, in the
present part of our subject we shall for the most part be able to
neglect them.</p>

<p>Our equation is an equation of equi­lib­rium. The resistance
to compression,—the pressure outwards,—of our fluid mass, is a
constant quantity (<i>P</i>); the pressure inwards, <i>T</i>(1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>R</i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>R&#xfeff;′</i>), is
also constant; and if (unlike the case of the mobile amoeba) the
surface be homogeneous, so that <i>T</i> is everywhere equal, it follows
that throughout the whole surface 1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>R</i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>R&#xfeff;′</i>
=&#x202f;<i>C</i> (a constant).</p>

<p>Now equi­lib­rium is attained after the surface contraction has
done its utmost, that is to say when it has reduced the surface
to the smallest possible area; and so we arrive, from the physical
side, at the conclusion that a surface such that 1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>R</i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>R&#xfeff;′</i>
=&#x202f;<i>C</i>,
in other words a surface which has the same <i>mean curvature</i> at
all points, is equivalent to a surface of minimal area: and to the
same conclusion we may also arrive through purely analytical
mathematics. It is obvious that the plane and the sphere are two
examples of such surfaces, for in both cases the radius of curvature
is everywhere constant, being equal to infinity in the case of the
plane, and to some definite magnitude in the case of the sphere.</p>

<p>From the fact that we may extend a soap-film across a ring of
wire however fantastically the latter may be bent, we realise that
there is no limit to the number of surfaces of minimal area which
may be constructed or may be imagined; and while some of these
are very complicated indeed, some, for instance a spiral helicoid
screw, are relatively very simple. But if we
limit ourselves to <span class="xxpn" id="p218">{218}</span>
<i>surfaces of revolution</i> (that is to say, to surfaces symmetrical about
an axis), we find, as Plateau was the first to shew, that those which
meet the case are very few in number. They are six in all,
namely the plane, the sphere, the cylinder, the catenoid, the
unduloid, and a curious surface which Plateau called the nodoid.</p>

<p>These several surfaces are all closely related, and the passage
from one to another is generally easy. Their math­e­mat­i­cal interrelation
is expressed by the fact (first shewn by Delaunay<a class="afnanch" href="#fn286" id="fnanch286">286</a>,
in 1841)
that the plane curves by whose rotation they are generated are
themselves generated as “roulettes” of the conic sections.</p>

<p>Let us imagine a straight line upon which a circle, an ellipse
or other conic section rolls; the focus of the conic section will
describe a line in some relation to the fixed axis, and this line
(or roulette), rotating around the axis, will describe in space one or
other of the six surfaces of revolution with which we are dealing.</p>

<div class="dctr01" id="fig61">
<img src="images/i218.png" width="800" height="117" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 61.</div></div>

<p>If we imagine an ellipse so to roll over a line, either of its foci
will describe a sinuous or wavy line
<span class="nowrap">(Fig. <a href="#fig61" title="go to Fig. 61">61</a><span class="smmaj">B</span>)</span>
at a distance
alternately maximal and minimal from the axis; and this wavy
line, by rotation about the axis, becomes the meridional line of
the surface which we call the <i>unduloid</i>. The more unequal the
two axes are of our ellipse, the more pronounced will be the
sinuosity of the described roulette. If the two axes be equal,
then our ellipse becomes a circle, and the path described by its
rolling centre is a straight line parallel to the axis (A); and
obviously the solid of revolution generated therefrom will be a
<i>cylinder</i>. If one axis of our ellipse vanish, while the other remain
of finite length, then the ellipse is reduced to a straight line, and
its roulette will appear as a succession of semicircles touching one
another upon the axis (C); the solid of revolution will be a series of
equal <i>spheres</i>. If as before one axis of the ellipse vanish, but the
other be infinitely long, then the curve
described by the rotation <span class="xxpn" id="p219">{219}</span>
of this latter will be a circle of infinite radius, i.e. a straight line
infinitely distant from the axis; and the surface of rotation is now
a <i>plane</i>. If we imagine one focus of our ellipse to remain at a
given distance from the axis, but the other to become infinitely
remote, that is tantamount to saying that the ellipse becomes
transformed into a parabola; and by the rolling of this curve
along the axis there is described a catenary (D), whose solid of
revolution is the <i>catenoid</i>.</p>

<p>Lastly, but this is a little more difficult to imagine, we have
the case of the hyperbola.</p>

<p>We cannot well imagine the hyperbola rolling upon a fixed
straight line so that its focus shall describe a continuous curve.
But let us suppose that the fixed line is, to begin with, asymptotic
to one branch of the hyperbola, and that the rolling proceed
until the line is now asymptotic to the other branch, that is to
say touching it at an infinite distance; there will then be math­e­mat­i­cal
continuity if we recommence rolling with this second
branch, and so in turn with the other, when each has run its
course. We shall see, on reflection, that the line traced by one
and the same focus will be an “elastic curve” describing a succession
of kinks or knots (E), and the solid of revolution described
by this meridional line about the axis is the so-called <i>nodoid</i>.</p>

<p>The physical transition of one of these surfaces into another
can be experimentally illustrated by means of soap-bubbles, or
better still, after the method of Plateau, by means of a large
globule of oil, supported when necessary by wire rings, within a
fluid of specific gravity equal to its own.</p>

<p>To prepare a mixture of alcohol and water of a density precisely
equal to that of the oil-globule is a troublesome matter, and a
method devised by Mr C. R. Darling is a great improvement on
Plateau’s<a class="afnanch" href="#fn287" id="fnanch287">287</a>.
Mr Darling uses the oily liquid orthotoluidene, which
does not mix with water, has a beautiful and conspicuous red
colour, and has precisely the same density as water when both
are kept at a temperature of 24° C. We have therefore only to
run the liquid into water at this temperature in order to produce
beautifully spherical drops of any required
size: and by adding <span class="xxpn" id="p220">{220}</span>
a little salt to the lower layers of water, the drop may be made
to float or rest upon the denser liquid.</p>

<p>We have already seen that the soap-bubble, spherical to begin
with, is transformed into a plane when we relieve its internal
pressure and let the film shrink back upon the orifice of the pipe.
If we blow a small bubble and then catch it up on a second pipe,
so that it stretches between, we may gradually draw the two pipes
apart, with the result that the spheroidal surface will be gradually
flattened in a longitudinal direction, and the bubble will be transformed
into a cylinder. But if we draw the pipes yet farther
apart, the cylinder will narrow in the middle into a sort of hourglass
form, the increasing curvature of its transverse section being
balanced by a gradually increasing <i>negative</i> curvature in the
longitudinal section. The cylinder has, in turn, been converted
into an unduloid. When we hold a portion of a soft glass tube in
the flame, and “draw it out,” we are in the same identical fashion
converting a cylinder into an unduloid
<span class="nowrap">(Fig. <a href="#fig62" title="go to Fig. 62">62</a><span class="smmaj">A</span>);</span>
when on the
other hand we stop the end and blow, we again convert the
cylinder into an unduloid
<span class="nowrap">(<span class="smmaj">B</span>),</span>
but into one which is now positively,
while the former was negatively curved. The two figures are
essentially the same, save that the two halves of the one are
reversed in the other.</p>

<div class="dctr03" id="fig62">

<p>That spheres, cylinders and unduloids are of the commonest
occurrence among the forms of small unicellular organism, or of
individual cells in the simpler aggregates, and that in the processes
of growth, reproduction and development transitions are frequent
from one of these forms to another, is obvious to the naturalist,
and we shall deal presently with a few illustrations of these
phenomena.</p>

<p>But before we go further in this enquiry, it will be necessary
to consider, to some small extent at least, the <i>curvatures</i> of the
six different surfaces, that is to say, to
determine what modification <span class="xxpn" id="p221">{221}</span>
is required, in each case, of the general equation which applies
to them all. We shall find that with this question is closely
connected the question of the <i>pressures</i> exercised by, or impinging
on the film, and also the very important question of
the limitations which, from the nature of the case, exist to
prevent the extension of certain of the figures beyond certain
bounds. The whole subject is math­e­mat­i­cal, and we shall only
deal with it in the most elementary way.</p>

<p>We have seen that, in our general formula, the expression
1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>R</i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>R&#xfeff;′</i>
=&#x202f;<i>C</i>, a constant; and that this is, in all cases, the
condition of our surface being one of minimal area. In other
words, it is always true for one and all of the six surfaces which
we have to consider. But the constant <i>C</i> may have any value,
positive, negative, or nil.</p>

<p>In the case of the plane, where <i>R</i> and <i>R&#xfeff;′</i> are both infinite, it
is obvious that 1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>R</i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>R&#xfeff;′</i>
=&#x202f;0. The expression therefore vanishes,
and our dynamical equation of equi­lib­rium becomes <i>P</i>
=&#x202f;<i>p</i>. In
short, we can only have a plane film, or we shall only find a plane
surface in our cell, when on either side thereof we have equal
pressures or no pressure at all. A simple case is the plane partition
between two equal and similar cells, as in a filament of spirogyra.</p>

<p>In the case of the sphere, the radii are all equal, <i>R</i>
=&#x202f;<i>R&#xfeff;′</i>;
they are also positive, and <span class="nowrap">
<i>T</i>&#x200a;(1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>R</i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>R&#xfeff;′</i>),</span>
or <span class="nowrap">2&#x200a;<i>T&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;R</i>,</span> is a positive
quantity, involving a positive pressure <i>P</i>, on the other side of the
equation.</p>

<p>In the cylinder, one radius of curvature has the finite and
positive value <i>R</i>; but the other is infinite. Our formula becomes
<i>T&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;R</i>, to which corresponds a positive pressure <i>P</i>, supplied by the
surface-tension as in the case of the sphere, but evidently of just
half the magnitude developed in the latter case for a given value
of the radius <i>R</i>.</p>

<div class="dmaths">
<p>The catenoid has the remarkable property that its
curvature in one direction is precisely equal and opposite
to its curvature in the other, this property holding
good for all points of the surface. That is to say,
<i>R</i>
=&#x202f;−<i>R&#xfeff;′</i>; and the expression becomes</p>

<div>(1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>R</i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>R&#xfeff;′</i>)
=&#x202f;(1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>R</i>&#x202f;−&#x202f;1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>R</i>)
=&#x202f;0;</div>

<p class="pcontinue">in other words, the surface, as in the case of the
plane, has <i>no <span class="xxpn" id="p222">{222}</span>
curvature</i>, and exercises no pressure. There are no other surfaces,
save these two, which share this remarkable property; and it
follows, as a simple corollary, that we may expect at times to have
the catenoid and the plane coexisting, as parts of one and the
same boundary system; just as, in a cylindrical drop or cell, the
cylinder is capped by portions of spheres, such that the cylindrical
and spherical portions of the wall exert equal positive pressures.</p>
</div><!--dmaths-->

<p>In the unduloid, unlike the four surfaces which we have just
been considering, it is obvious that the curvatures change from
one point to another. At the middle of one of the swollen
portions, or “beads,” the two curvatures are both positive; the
expression (1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>R</i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>R&#xfeff;′</i>) is therefore positive, and it is also finite.
The film, accordingly, exercises a positive tension inwards, which
must be compensated by a finite and positive outward pressure
<i>P</i>. At the middle of one of the narrow necks, between two
adjacent beads, there is obviously, in the transverse direction,
a much stronger curvature than in the former case, and the curvature
which balances it is now a negative one. But the sum of the
two must remain positive, as well as constant; and we therefore
see that the convex or positive curvature must always be greater
than the concave or negative curvature at the same point. This
is plainly the case in our figure of the unduloid.</p>

<p>The nodoid is, like the unduloid, a continuous curve which
keeps altering its curvature as it alters its distance from the axis;
but in this case the resultant pressure inwards is negative instead
of positive. But this curve is a complicated one, and a full
discussion of it would carry us beyond our scope.</p>

<div class="dleft dwth-i" id="fig63">

 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 63.</div></div>

<p>In one of Plateau’s experiments, a bubble of oil (protected from
gravity by the specific gravity of the surrounding fluid being
identical with its own) is balanced between two
annuli. It may then be brought to assume the form
of Fig. <a href="#fig63" title="go to Fig. 63">63</a>, that is to say the form of a cylinder with
spherical ends; and there is then everywhere, owing
to the convexity of the surface film, a pressure
inwards upon the fluid contents of the bubble. If
the surrounding liquid be ever so little heavier or
lighter than that which constitutes the drop, then
the conditions of equi­lib­rium
will be accordingly <span class="xxpn" id="p223">{223}</span>
modified, and the cylindrical drop will assume the form of an
unduloid (Fig. <a href="#fig64" title="go to Fig. 64">64</a> <span class="smmaj">A,</span>
<span class="nowrap"><span class="smmaj">B</span>),</span>
with its dilated portion below or above,<br class="brclrfix" /></p>

 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 64.</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">as the case may be; and our cylinder
may also, of course, be converted into an unduloid either by
elongating it further, or by abstracting a portion of its oil,
until at length rupture ensues and the cylinder breaks up into
two new spherical drops. In all cases alike, the unduloid, like
the original cylinder, will be capped by spherical ends, which
are the sign, and the consequence, of the positive pressure
produced by the curved walls of the unduloid. But if our
initial cylinder, instead of being tall, be a flat or dumpy one
(with certain definite relations of height to breadth), then
new phenomena may be exhibited. For now, if a little oil be
cautiously withdrawn from the mass by help of a small syringe,
the cylinder may be made to flatten down so that its upper and
lower surfaces become plane; which is of itself an indication
that the pressure inwards is now <i>nil</i>. But at the very moment
when the upper and lower surfaces become plane, it will be
found that the sides curve inwards, in the fashion shewn in
Fig. <a href="#fig65" title="go to Fig. 65">65</a><span class="smmaj">B.</span> This figure is a catenoid,
which, as<br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<p class="pcontinue">we have already seen, is, like the
plane itself, a surface exercising no pressure, and which
therefore may coexist with the plane as part of one and the
same system. We may continue to withdraw more oil from our
bubble, drop by drop, and now the upper and lower surfaces
dimple down into concave portions of spheres, as the result of
the <i>negative</i> internal pressure; and thereupon the peripheral
catenoid surface alters its form (perhaps, on this small
scale, imperceptibly), and becomes a portion of a nodoid <span
class="nowrap">(Fig. <a href="#fig65" title="go to Fig. 65">65</a><span class="smmaj">A</span>).</span>
<span class="xxpn" id="p224">{224}</span> It represents,
in fact, that portion of the nodoid, which in Fig. <a href="#fig66" title="go to Fig. 66">66</a> lies
between such points as <span class="smmaj">O,</span> <span
class="smmaj">P.</span> While it is easy to<br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<p class="pcontinue">draw the outline, or meridional
section, of the nodoid (as in
Fig. <a href="#fig66" title="go to Fig. 66">66</a>), it is obvious that the
solid of revolution to be derived
from it, can never be realised in
its entirety: for one part of the
solid figure would cut, or entangle
with, another. All that
we can ever do, accordingly, is to realise isolated portions of the
nodoid.<br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<p>If, in a sequel to the preceding experiment of Plateau’s, we
use solid discs instead of annuli, so as to enable us to exert direct
mechanical pressure upon our globule of oil, we again begin by
adjusting the pressure of these discs so that the oil assumes the
form of a cylinder: our discs, that is to say, are adjusted to
exercise a mechanical pressure equal to what in the former case
was supplied by the surface-tension of the spherical caps or ends
of the bubble. If we now increase the pressure slightly, the
peripheral walls will become convexly curved, exercising a precisely
cor­re­spon­ding pressure. Under these circumstances the
form assumed by the sides of our figure will be that of a portion
of an unduloid. If we increase the pressure between the discs,
the peripheral surface of oil will bulge out more and more, and
will presently constitute a portion of a sphere. But we may
continue the process yet further, and within certain limits we shall
find that the system remains perfectly stable. What is this new
curved surface which has arisen out of the sphere, as the latter
was produced from the unduloid? It is no other than a portion
of a nodoid, that part which in Fig. <a href="#fig66" title="go to Fig. 66">66</a> lies between such limits as
<span class="smmaj">M</span>
and <span class="smmaj">N.</span> But this surface, which is concave in both directions
towards the surface of the oil within, is exerting a pressure upon
the latter, just as did the sphere out of which a moment ago it
was transformed; and we had just stated, in considering the
previous experiment, that the pressure inwards exerted by the
nodoid was a negative one. The explanation of this seeming
discrepancy lies in the simple fact that, if we
follow the outline <span class="xxpn" id="p225">{225}</span>
of our nodoid curve in Fig. <a href="#fig66" title="go to Fig. 66">66</a> from <span class="smmaj">O,</span> <span class="smmaj">P,</span> the surface concerned
in the former case, to <span class="smmaj">M,</span> <span class="smmaj">N,</span> that concerned in the present, we shall
see that in the two experiments the surface of the liquid is not
homologous, but lies on the positive side of the curve in the one
case and on the negative side in the other.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Of all the surfaces which we have been describing, the sphere
is the only one which can enclose space; the others can only help
to do so, in combination with one another or with the sphere itself.
Thus we have seen that, in normal equi­lib­rium, the cylindrical
vesicle is closed at either end by a portion of a sphere, and so on.
Moreover the sphere is not only the only one of our figures which
can enclose a finite space; it is also, of all possible figures, that
which encloses the greatest volume with the least area of surface;
it is strictly and absolutely the surface of minimal area, and it
is therefore the form which will be naturally assumed by a unicellular
organism (just as by a raindrop), when it is practically
homogeneous and when, like Orbulina floating in the ocean, its
surroundings are likewise practically homogeneous and symmetrical.
It is only relatively speaking that all the rest are
surfaces <i>minimae areae</i>; they are so, that is to say, under the
given conditions, which involve various forms of pressure or
restraint. Such restraints are imposed, for instance, by the
pipes or annuli with the help of which we draw out our cylindrical
or unduloid oil-globule or soap-bubble; and in the case of the
organic cell, similar restraints are constantly supplied by solidification,
partial or complete, local or general, of the cell-wall.</p>

<p>Before we pass to biological illustrations of our surface-tension
figures, we have still another preliminary matter to deal with.
We have seen from our description of two of Plateau’s classical
experiments, that at some particular point one type of surface
gives place to another; and again, we know that, when we draw
out our soap-bubble into and then beyond a cylinder, there comes
a certain definite point at which our bubble breaks in two, and
leaves us with two bubbles of which each is a sphere, or a portion
of a sphere. In short there are certain definite limits to the
<i>dimensions</i> of our figures, within which limits equi­lib­rium is
stable but at which it becomes unstable, and
above which it <span class="xxpn" id="p226">{226}</span>
breaks down. Moreover in our composite surfaces, when the
cylinder for instance is capped by two spherical cups or lenticular
discs, there is a well-defined ratio which regulates their respective
curvatures, and therefore their respective dimensions. These two
matters we may deal with together.</p>

<p>Let us imagine a liquid drop which by appropriate conditions
has been made to assume the form of a cylinder; we have already
seen that its ends will be terminated by portions of spheres.
Since one and the same liquid film covers the sides and ends of
the drop (or since one and the same delicate membrane encloses
the sides and ends of the cell), we assume the surface-tension (<i>T</i>)
to be everywhere identical; and it follows, since the internal
fluid-pressure is also everywhere identical, that the expression
(1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>R</i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>R&#xfeff;′</i>) for the cylinder is equal to the cor­re­spon­ding expression,
which we may call (1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>r</i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>r&#xfeff;′</i>), in the case of the terminal
spheres. But in the cylinder 1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>R&#xfeff;′</i>
=&#x202f;0, and in the sphere 1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>r</i>
=&#x202f;1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>r&#xfeff;′</i>.
Therefore our relation of equality becomes 1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>R</i>
=&#x202f;2&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>r</i>, or <i>r</i> <span class="nowrap">
=&#x202f;2&#x200a;<i>R</i>;</span>
that is to say, the sphere in question has just twice the radius of
the cylinder of which it forms a cap.</p>

<div class="dleft dwth-e" id="fig67">
<img src="images/i226.png" width="316" height="396" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 67.</div></div>

<div class="dmaths">
<p>And if <i>Ob</i>, the radius of the sphere, be equal to twice the radius
(<i>Oa</i>) of the cylinder, it follows that the angle <i>aOb</i> is an angle of
60°, and <i>bOc</i> is also an angle of 60°;
that is to say, the arc <i>bc</i> is equal to <span class="nowrap">
(&#xfeff;<sup>1</sup>&#xfeff;&#x2044;&#xfeff;<sub>3</sub>)&#x200a;π.</span>
In other words, the spherical
disc which (under the given conditions)
caps our cylinder, is not a portion
taken at haphazard, but is neither
more nor less than that portion of a
sphere which is subtended by a cone
of 60°. Moreover, it is plain that

<p>Among the many important theoretical discoveries which we
owe to Plateau, one to which we have just referred is of peculiar
importance: namely that, with the exception of the sphere and
the plane, the surfaces with which we have been dealing are only
in complete equi­lib­rium within certain dimensional limits, or in
other words, have a certain definite limit of stability; only the plane
and the sphere, or any portions of a sphere, are perfectly stable,
because they are perfectly symmetrical, figures. For experimental
demonstration, the case of the cylinder is the simplest. If we
produce a liquid film having the form of a cylinder, either by</p>

 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 68.</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">drawing out a bubble or by supporting between two rings a
globule of oil, the experiment proceeds easily until the length of
the cylinder becomes just about three times as great as its diameter.
But somewhere about this limit the cylinder alters its form; it
begins to narrow at the waist, so passing into an unduloid, and
the deformation progresses quickly until at last our cylinder
breaks in two, and its two halves assume a spherical form. It is
found, by theoretical con­si­de­ra­tions, that the precise limit of
stability is at the point when the length of the cylinder is exactly
equal to its circumference, that is to say, when <i>L</i>
=&#x202f;2π<i>R</i>, or when
the ratio of length to diameter is represented by π.</p>

<p>In the case of the catenoid, Plateau’s experimental procedure
was as follows. To support his globule of oil (in, as usual, a
mixture of alcohol and water of its own specific
gravity), he used <span class="xxpn" id="p228">{228}</span>
a pair of metal rings, which happened to have a diameter of
71 millimetres; and, in a series of experiments, he set these rings
apart at distances of 55, 49, 47, 45, and 43 mm. successively.
In each case he began by bringing his oil-globule into a cylindrical
form, by sucking superfluous oil out of the drop until this result
was attained; and always, for the reason with which we are now
acquainted, the cylindrical sides were associated with spherical
ends to the cylinder. On continuing to withdraw oil in the hope
of converting these spherical ends into planes, he found, naturally,
that the sides of the cylinder drew in to form a concave surface;
but it was by no means easy to get the extremities actually plane:
and unless they were so, thus indicating that the surface-pressure
of the drop was nil, the curvature of the sides could not be that
of a catenoid. For in the first experiment, when the rings were
55 mm. apart, as soon as the convexity of the ends was to a certain
extent diminished, it spontaneously increased again; and the
transverse constriction of the globule correspondingly deepened,
until at a certain point equi­lib­rium set in anew. Indeed, the more
oil he removed, the more convex became the ends, until at last
the increasing transverse constriction led to the breaking of the
oil-globule into two. In the third experiment, when the rings
were 47 mm. apart, it was easy to obtain end-surfaces that were
actually plane, and they remained so even though more oil was
withdrawn, the transverse constriction deepening accordingly.
Only after a considerable amount of oil had been sucked up did
the plane terminal surface become gradually convex, and presently
the narrow waist, narrowing more and more, broke across in the
usual way. Finally in the fifth experiment, where the rings were
still nearer together, it was again possible to bring the ends of the
oil-globule to a plane surface, as in the third and fourth experiments,
and to keep this surface plane in spite of some continued withdrawal
of oil. But very soon the ends became gradually concave,
and the concavity deepened as more and more oil was withdrawn,
until at a certain limit, the whole oil-globule broke up in general
disruption.</p>

<p>We learn from this that the limiting size of the catenoid was
reached when the distance of the supporting rings was to their
diameter as 47 to 71, or, as nearly as possible, as
two to three; <span class="xxpn" id="p229">{229}</span>
and as a matter of fact it can be shewn that 2&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;3 is the true
theoretical value. Above this limit of 2&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;3, the inevitable convexity
of the end-surfaces shows that a positive pressure inwards is being
exerted by the surface film, and this teaches us that the sides of
the figure actually constitute not a catenoid but an unduloid,
whose spontaneous changes tend to a form of greater stability.
Below the 2&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;3 limit the catenoid surface is essentially unstable,
and the form into which it passes under certain conditions of
disturbance such as that of the excessive withdrawal of oil, is
that of a nodoid
<span class="nowrap">(Fig. <a href="#fig65" title="go to Fig. 65">65</a><span class="smmaj">A</span>).</span></p>

<p>The unduloid has certain peculiar properties as regards its
limitations of stability. But as to these we need mention two
facts only: (1) that when the unduloid, which we produce with
our soap-bubble or our oil-globule, consists of the figure containing
a complete constriction, it has somewhat wide limits of stability;
but (2) if it contain the swollen portion, then equi­lib­rium is limited
to the condition that the figure consists simply of one complete
unduloid, that is to say that its ends are constituted by the
narrowest portions, and its middle by the widest portion of the
entire curve. The theoretical proof of this latter fact is difficult,
but if we take the proof for granted, the fact will serve to throw
light on what we have learned regarding the stability of the cylinder.
For, when we remember that the meridional section of our unduloid
is generated by the rolling of an ellipse upon a straight line in its
own plane, we shall easily see that the length of the entire unduloid
is equal to the circumference of the generating ellipse. As the
unduloid becomes less and less sinuous in outline, it gradually
approaches, and in time reaches, the form of a cylinder; and
correspondingly, the ellipse which generated it has its foci more
and more approximated until it passes into a circle. The cylinder
of a length equal to the circumference of its generating circle is
therefore precisely homologous to an unduloid whose length is
equal to the circumference of its generating ellipse; and this is
just what we recognise as constituting one complete segment of
the unduloid.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>While the figures of equi­lib­rium which are at the same time
surfaces of revolution are only six in number, there
is an infinite <span class="xxpn" id="p230">{230}</span>
number of figures of equi­lib­rium, that is to say of surfaces of
constant mean curvature, which are not surfaces of revolution;
and it can be shewn math­e­mat­i­cally that any given contour can
be occupied by a finite portion of some one such surface, in stable
equi­lib­rium. The experimental verification of this theorem lies in
the simple fact (already noted) that however we may bend a wire
into a closed curve, plane or not plane, we may always, under
appropriate precautions, fill the entire area with an unbroken
film.</p>

<p>Of the regular figures of equi­lib­rium, that is to say surfaces
of constant mean curvature, apart from the surfaces of revolution
which we have discussed, the helicoid spiral is the most interesting
to the biologist. This is a helicoid generated by a straight line
perpendicular to an axis, about which it turns at a uniform rate
while at the same time it slides, also uniformly, along this same
axis. At any point in this surface, the curvatures are equal and
of opposite sign, and the sum of the curvatures is accordingly nil.
Among what are called “ruled surfaces” (which we may describe
as surfaces capable of being defined by a system of stretched
strings), the plane and the helicoid are the only two whose mean
curvature is null, while the cylinder is the only one whose curvature
is finite and constant. As this simplest of helicoids corresponds,
in three dimensions, to what in two dimensions is merely a plane
(the latter being generated by the rotation of a straight line about
an axis without the superadded gliding motion which generates
the helicoid), so there are other and much more complicated
helicoids which correspond to the sphere, the unduloid and the
rest of our figures of revolution, the generating planes of these
latter being supposed to wind spirally about an axis. In the case
of the cylinder it is obvious that the resulting figure is in­dis­tin­guish­able
from the cylinder itself. In the case of the unduloid we
obtain a grooved spiral, such as we may meet with in nature (for
instance in Spirochætes, <i>Bodo gracilis</i>, etc.), and which accordingly
it is of interest to us to be able to recognise as a surface of minimal
area or constant curvature.</p>

<p>The foregoing con­si­de­ra­tions deal with a small part only
of the theory of surface tension, or of capillarity: with that
part, namely, which relates to the forms of
surface which are <span class="xxpn" id="p231">{231}</span>
capable of subsisting in equi­lib­rium under the action of that force,
either of itself or subject to certain simple constraints. And as
yet we have limited ourselves to the case of a single surface, or
of a single drop or bubble, leaving to another occasion a discussion
of the forms assumed when such drops or vesicles meet and combine
together. In short, what we have said may help us to understand
the form of a <i>cell</i>,—considered, as with certain limitations
we may legitimately consider it, as a liquid drop or liquid vesicle;
the conformation of a <i>tissue</i> or cell-aggregate must be dealt with
in the light of another series of theoretical con­si­de­ra­tions. In
both cases, we can do no more than touch upon the fringe of a
large and difficult subject. There are many forms capable of
realisation under surface tension, and many of them doubtless to
be recognised among organisms, which we cannot touch upon in
this elementary account. The subject is a very general one; it
is, in its essence, more math­e­mat­i­cal than physical; it is part of
the mathematics of surfaces, and only comes into relation with
surface tension, because this physical phenomenon illustrates and
exemplifies, in a concrete way, most of the simple and symmetrical
conditions with which the general math­e­mat­i­cal theory is capable
of dealing. And before we pass to illustrate by biological examples
the physical phenomena which we have described, we must be
careful to remember that the physical conditions which we have
hitherto presupposed will never be wholly realised in the organic
cell. Its substance will never be a perfect fluid, and hence
equi­lib­rium will be more or less slowly reached; its surface will
seldom be perfectly homogeneous, and therefore equi­lib­rium will
(in the fluid condition) seldom be perfectly attained; it will very
often, or generally, be the seat of other forces, symmetrical or
unsymmetrical; and all these causes will more or less perturb the
effects of surface tension acting by itself. But we shall find that,
on the whole, these effects of surface tension though modified are
not obliterated nor even masked; and accordingly the phenomena
to which I have devoted the foregoing pages will be found
manifestly recurring and repeating themselves among the phenomena
of the organic cell.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>In a spider’s web we find exemplified several
of the principles <span class="xxpn" id="p232">{232}</span>
of surface tension which we have now explained. The thread is
formed out of the fluid secretion of a gland, and issues from the
body as a semi-fluid cylinder, that is to say in the form of a surface
of equi­lib­rium, the force of expulsion giving it its elongation and
that of surface tension giving it its circular section. It is prevented,
by almost immediate solidification on exposure to the air, from
breaking up into separate drops or spherules, as it would otherwise
tend to do as soon as the length of the cylinder had passed its
limit of stability. But it is otherwise with the sticky secretion
which, coming from another gland, is simultaneously poured over
the issuing thread when it is to form the spiral portion of the
web. This latter secretion is more fluid than the first, and retains
its fluidity for a very much longer time, finally drying up after
several hours. By capillarity it “wets” the thread, spreading
itself over it in an even film, which film is now itself a cylinder.
But this liquid cylinder has its limit of stability when its length
equals its own circumference, and therefore just at the points so
defined it tends to disrupt into separate segments: or rather, in
the actual case, at points somewhat more distant, owing to the
imperfect fluidity of the viscous film, and still more to the frictional
drag upon it of the inner solid cylinder, or thread, with which it
is in contact. The cylinder disrupts in the usual manner, passing
first into the wavy outline of an unduloid, whose swollen portions
swell more and more till the contracted parts break asunder, and
we arrive at a series of spherical drops or beads, of equal size,
strung at equal intervals along the thread. If we try to spread
varnish over a thin stretched wire, we produce automatically the
same identical result<a class="afnanch" href="#fn288" id="fnanch288">288</a>;
unless our varnish be such as to dry almost
instantaneously, it gathers into beads, and do what we can, we
fail to spread it smooth. It follows that, according to the viscidity
and drying power of the varnish, the process may stop or seem to
stop at any point short of the formation of the perfect spherules;
it is quite possible, therefore, that as our final stage we may only
obtain half-formed beads, or the wavy outline of an unduloid.
The formation of the beads may be facilitated or hastened by
jerking the stretched thread, as the spider
actually does: the <span class="xxpn" id="p233">{233}</span>
effect of the jerk being to disturb and destroy the unstable
equi­lib­rium of the viscid cylinder<a class="afnanch" href="#fn289" id="fnanch289">289</a>.
Another very curious
phenomenon here presents itself.</p>

<p>In Plateau’s experimental separation of a cylinder of oil into
two spherical portions, it was noticed that, when contact was
nearly broken, that is to say when the narrow neck of the unduloid
had become very thin, the two spherical bullae, instead of absorbing
the fluid out of the narrow neck into themselves as they had done
with the preceding portion, drew out this small remaining part of
the liquid into a thin thread as they completed their spherical
form and consequently receded from one another: the reason being
that, after the thread or “neck” has reached a certain tenuity,
the internal friction of the fluid prevents or retards its rapid exit
from the little thread to the adjacent spherule. It is for the same
reason that we are able to draw a glass rod or tube, which we have
heated in the middle, into a long and uniform cylinder or thread,
by quickly separating the two ends. But in the case of the glass
rod, the long thin intermediate cylinder quickly cools and solidifies,
while in the ordinary separation of a liquid cylinder the cor­re­spon­ding
intermediate cylinder remains liquid; and therefore, like
any other liquid cylinder, it is liable to break up, provided that its
dimensions exceed the normal limit of stability. And its length
is generally such that it breaks at two points, thus leaving two
terminal portions continuous with the spheres and becoming
confluent with these, and one median portion which resolves itself
into a comparatively tiny spherical drop, midway between the
original and larger two. Occasionally, the same process of formation
of a connecting thread repeats itself a second time, between
the small intermediate spherule and the large spheres; and in this
case we obviously obtain two additional spherules, still smaller in
size, and lying one on either side of our first little one. This whole
phenomenon, of equal and regularly interspaced beads, often with
little beads regularly interspaced between the larger ones, and
possibly also even a third series of still smaller beads regularly
intercalated, may be easily observed in a spider’s web, such as
that of <i>Epeira</i>, very often with beautiful
regularity,—which <span class="xxpn" id="p234">{234}</span>
naturally, however, is sometimes interrupted and disturbed owing
to a slight want of homogeneity in the secreted fluid; and the
same phenomenon is repeated on a grosser scale when the web is
bespangled with dew, and every thread bestrung with pearls
innumerable. To the older naturalists, these regularly arranged
and beautifully formed globules on the spider’s web were a cause
of great wonder and admiration. Blackwall, counting some
twenty globules in a tenth of an inch, calculated that a large
garden-spider’s web comprised about 120,000 globules; the net
was spun and finished in about forty minutes, and Blackwall was
evidently filled with astonishment at the skill and quickness with
which the spider manufactured these little beads. And no wonder,
for according to the above estimate they had to be made at the
rate of about 50 per second<a class="afnanch" href="#fn290" id="fnanch290">290</a>.</p>

 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 69. Hair of <i>Trianea</i>,

<p>The little delicate beads which stud the long thin
pseudopodia of a foraminifer, such as <i>Gromia</i>, or which in
like manner appear upon the cylindrical film of protoplasm
which covers the long radiating spicules of <i>Globigerina</i>,
represent an identical phenomenon. Indeed there are many cases,
in which we may study in a protoplasmic filament the whole
process of formation of such beads. If we squeeze out on to
a slide the viscid contents of a mistletoe berry, the long
sticky threads into which the substance runs shew the whole
phenomenon particularly well. Another way to demonstrate it was
noticed many years ago by Hofmeister and afterwards explained
by Berthold. The hairs of certain water-plants, such as
Hydrocharis or Trianea, constitute very long cylindrical cells,
the protoplasm being supported, and maintained in equi­lib­rium
by its contact with the cell-wall. But if we immerse the
filament in some dense fluid, a little sugar-solution for
instance, or dilute glycerine, the cell-sap tends to diffuse
outwards, the protoplasm parts company with its surrounding and
supporting wall, <span class="xxpn" id="p235">{235}</span> and
lies free as a protoplasmic cylinder in the interior of the
cell. Thereupon it immediately shews signs of instability, and
commences to disrupt. It tends to gather into spheres, which
however, as in our illustration, may be prevented by their
narrow quarters from assuming the complete spherical form;
and in between these spheres, we have more or less regularly
alternate ones, of smaller size<a class="afnanch" href="#fn291"
id="fnanch291">291</a>. Similar, but less regular, beads or
droplets may be caused to appear, under stimulation by an
alternating current, in the protoplasmic threads within the
living cells of the hairs of Tradescantia. The explanation
usually given is, that the viscosity of the protoplasm
is reduced, or its fluidity increased; but an increase
of the surface tension would seem a more likely reason&#xfeff;<a

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>We may take note here of a remarkable series of phenomena,
which, though they seem at first sight to be of a very different
order, are closely related to the phenomena which attend and
which bring about the breaking-up of a liquid cylinder or thread.</p>

<img src="images/i235.png" width="800" height="474" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 70. Phases of a Splash.
 (From Worthington.)</div></div>

<p>In some of Mr Worthington’s most beautiful
experiments on <span class="xxpn" id="p236">{236}</span>
splashes, it was found that the fall of a round pebble into water
from a considerable height, caused the rise of a filmy sheet of water
in the form of a cup or cylinder; and the edge of this cylindrical
film tended to be cut up into alternate lobes and notches, and the
prominent lobes or “jets” tended, in more extreme cases, to break
off or to break up into spherical beads (Fig.
<a href="#fig70" title="go to Fig. 70">70</a>)<a class="afnanch" href="#fn293" id="fnanch293">293</a>.
A precisely
similar appearance is seen, on a great scale, in the thin edge of a
breaking wave: when the smooth cylindrical edge, at a given
moment, shoots out an array of tiny jets which break up into
the droplets which constitute “spray” (Fig. <a href="#fig71" title="go to Fig. 71">71</a>, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>). We
are at once reminded of the beautifully symmetrical notching on
the calycles of many hydroids, which little cups before they became
stiff and rigid had begun their existence as liquid or semi-liquid
films.</p>

<div class="dctr01" id="fig71">
<img src="images/i236.png" width="800" height="177" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 71. A breaking wave. (From Worthington.)</div></div>

<p>The phenomenon is two-fold. In the first place, the edge of
our tubular or crater-like film forms a liquid ring or annulus,
which is closely comparable with the liquid thread or cylinder
which we have just been considering, if only we conceive the thread
to be bent round into the ring. And accordingly, just as the thread
spontaneously segments, first into an unduloid, and then into
separate spherical drops, so likewise will the edge of our annulus
tend to do. This phase of notching, or beading, of the edge of
the film is beautifully seen in many of Worthington’s experiments<a class="afnanch" href="#fn294" id="fnanch294">294</a>.
In the second place, the very fact of the rising of the crater means
that liquid is flowing up from below towards the rim; and the
segmentation of the rim means that channels
of easier flow are <span class="xxpn" id="p237">{237}</span>
created, along which the liquid is led, or is driven, into the protuberances:
and these are thus exaggerated into the jets or arms
which are sometimes so conspicuous at the edge of the crater.
In short, any film or film-like cup, fluid or semi-fluid in its consistency,
will, like the straight liquid cylinder, be unstable: and its
instability will manifest itself (among other ways) in a tendency
to segmentation or notching of the edge; and just such a peripheral
notching is a conspicuous feature of many minute organic cup-like
structures. In the case of the hydroid calycle
(Fig. <a href="#fig72" title="go to Fig. 72">72</a>), we are led
to the conclusion that the two common and conspicuous features
of notching or indentation of the cup, and of constriction or
annulation of the long cylindrical stem, are phenomena of the
same order and are due to surface-tension in both cases alike.</p>

 raridentata</i>.</div></div>

<p>Another phenomenon displayed in the same experiments is the
formation of a rope-like or cord-like thickening of the edge of the
annulus. This is due to the more or less sudden checking at the
rim of the flow of liquid rising from below: and a similar peripheral
thickening is frequently seen, not only in some of our hydroid
cups, but in many Vorticellas (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig75" title="go to Fig. 75">75</a>), and other organic
cup-like conformations. A perusal of Mr Worthington’s book
will soon suggest that these are not the only manifestations of
surface-tension in connection with splashes which present curious
resemblances and analogies to phenomena of organic form.</p>

<p>The phenomena of an ordinary liquid splash
are so swiftly <span class="xxpn" id="p238">{238}</span>
transitory that their study is only rendered possible by “instantaneous”
photography: but this excessive rapidity is not an
essential part of the phenomenon. For instance, we can repeat
and demonstrate many of the simpler phenomena, in a permanent
or quasi-permanent form, by splashing water on to a surface of
dry sand, or by firing a bullet into a soft metal target. There is
nothing, then, to prevent a slow and lasting manifestation, in
a viscous medium such as a protoplasmic organism, of phenomena
which appear and disappear with prodigious rapidity in a more
mobile liquid. Nor is there anything peculiar in the “splash”
itself; it is simply a convenient method of setting up certain
motions or currents, and producing certain surface-forms, in a
liquid medium,—or even in such an extremely imperfect fluid as
is represented (in another series of experiments) by a bed of sand.
Accordingly, we have a large range of possible conditions under
which the organism might conceivably display con­fi­gur­a­tions
analogous to, or identical with, those which Mr Worthington has
shewn us how to exhibit by one particular experimental method.</p>

<p>To one who has watched the potter at his wheel, it is plain
that the potter’s thumb, like the glass-blower’s blast of air,
depends for its efficacy upon the physical properties of the
medium on which it operates, which for the time being is essentially
a fluid. The cup and the saucer, like the tube and the bulb,
display (in their simple and primitive forms) beautiful surfaces of
equi­lib­rium as manifested under certain limiting conditions.
They are neither more nor less than glorified “splashes,” formed
slowly, under conditions of restraint which enhance or reveal
their math­e­mat­i­cal symmetry. We have seen, and we shall see
again before we are done, that the art of the glass-blower is full
of lessons for the naturalist as also for the physicist: illustrating
as it does the development of a host of math­e­mat­i­cal con­fi­gur­a­tions
and organic conformations which depend essentially on the
establishment of a constant and uniform pressure within a <i>closed</i>
elastic shell or fluid envelope. In like manner the potter’s art
illustrates the somewhat obscurer and more complex problems
(scarcely less frequent in biology) of a figure of equi­lib­rium which
is an <i>open</i> surface, or solid, of revolution. It is clear, at the same
time, that the two series of problems are closely
akin; for the <span class="xxpn" id="p239">{239}</span>
glass-blower can make most things that the potter makes, by
cutting off <i>portions</i> of his hollow ware. And besides, when this
fails, and the glass-blower, ceasing to blow, begins to use his rod
to trim the sides or turn the edges of wineglass or of beaker, he
is merely borrowing a trick from the craft of the potter.</p>

<p>It would be venturesome indeed to extend our comparison
with these liquid surface-tension phenomena from the cup or
calycle of the hydrozoon to the little hydroid polype within: and
yet I feel convinced that there is something to be learned by such
a comparison, though not without much detailed consideration
and math­e­mat­i­cal study of the surfaces concerned. The cylindrical
body of the tiny polype, the jet-like row of tentacles, the
beaded annulations which these tentacles exhibit, the web-like
film which sometimes (when they stand a little way apart) conjoins
their bases, the thin annular film of tissue which surrounds the
little organism’s mouth, and the manner in which this annular
“peristome” contracts<a class="afnanch" href="#fn295" id="fnanch295">295</a>,
like a shrinking soap-bubble, to close the
aperture, are every one of them features to which we may find
a singular and striking parallel in the surface-tension phenomena
which Mr Worthington has illustrated and demonstrated in the
case of the splash.</p>

<p>Here however, we may freely confess that we are for the
present on the uncertain ground of suggestion and conjecture;
and so must we remain, in regard to many other simple and
symmetrical organic forms, until their form and dynamical
stability shall have been investigated by the mathematician: in
other words, until the mathematicians shall have become persuaded
that there is an immense unworked field wherein they may labour,
in the detailed study of organic form.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>According to Plateau, the viscidity of the liquid, while it
helps to retard the breaking up of the cylinder and so increases
the length of the segments beyond that which theory demands,
has nevertheless less influence in this direction than we might
have expected. On the other hand, any external support or
adhesion, such as contact with a solid body, will be equivalent to
a reduction of surface-tension and so will very
greatly increase the <span class="xxpn" id="p240">{240}</span>
stability of our cylinder. It is for this reason that the mercury
in our thermometer tubes does not as a rule separate into drops,
though it occasionally does so, much to our inconvenience. And
again it is for this reason that the protoplasm in a long and growing
tubular or cylindrical cell does not necessarily divide into separate
cells and internodes, until the length of these far exceeds the
theoretic limits. Of course however and whenever it does so, we
must, without ever excluding the agency of surface tension,
remember that there may be other forces affecting the latter, and
accelerating or retarding that manifestation of surface tension by
which the cell is actually rounded off and divided.</p>

<p>In most liquids, Plateau asserts that, on the average, the
influence of viscosity is such as to cause the cylinder to segment
when its length is about four times, or at most from four to six
times that of its diameter: instead of a fraction over three times
as, in a perfect fluid, theory would demand. If we take it at
four times, it may then be shewn that the resulting spheres would
have a diameter of about 1·8 times, and their distance apart would
be equal to about 2·2 times the diameter of the original cylinder.
The calculation is not difficult which would shew how these
numbers are altered in the case of a cylinder formed around a solid
core, as in the case of the spider’s web. Plateau has also made
the interesting observation that the <i>time</i> taken in the process of
division of the cylinder is directly proportional to the diameter
of the cylinder, while varying considerably with the nature of the
liquid. This question, of the time occupied in the division of a
cell or filament, in relation to the dimensions of the latter, has not
so far as I know been enquired into by biologists.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>From the simple fact that the sphere is of all surfaces that
whose surface-area for a given volume is an absolute minimum,
we have already seen it to be plain that it is the one and only
figure of equi­lib­rium which will be assumed under surface-tension
by a drop or vesicle, when no other disturbing factors are present.
One of the most important of these disturbing factors will be
introduced, in the form of complicated tensions and pressures,
when one drop is in contact with another drop and when a system
of intermediate films or partition walls is
developed between them. <span class="xxpn" id="p241">{241}</span>
This subject we shall discuss later, in connection with cell-aggregates
or tissues, and we shall find that further theoretical
con­si­de­ra­tions are needed as a preliminary to any such enquiry.
Meanwhile let us consider a few cases of the forms of cells, either
solitary, or in such simple aggregates that their individual form is
little disturbed thereby.</p>

<p>Let us clearly understand that the cases we are about to
consider are those cases where the perfect symmetry of the sphere
is replaced by another symmetry, less complete, such as that of
an ellipsoidal or cylindrical cell. The cases of asymmetrical
deformation or displacement, such as is illustrated in the production
of a bud or the development of a lateral branch, are much simpler.
For here we need only assume a slight and localised variation of
surface-tension, such as may be brought about in various ways
through the heterogeneous chemistry of the cell; to this point
we shall return in our chapter on Adsorption. But the diffused
and graded asymmetry of the system, which brings about for
instance the ellipsoidal shape of a yeast-cell, is another matter.</p>

<p>If the sphere be the one surface of complete symmetry and
therefore of independent equi­lib­rium, it follows that in every cell
which is otherwise conformed there must be some definite force
to cause its departure from sphericity; and if this cause be the
very simple and obvious one of the resistance offered by a solidified
envelope, such as an egg-shell or firm cell-wall, we must still seek
for the deforming force which was in action to bring about the
given shape, prior to the assumption of rigidity. Such a cause
may be either external to, or may lie within, the cell itself. On
the one hand it may be due to external pressure or to some form
of mechanical restraint: as it is in all our experiments in which
we submit our bubble to the partial restraint of discs or rings or
more complicated cages of wire; and on the other hand it may be
due to intrinsic causes, which must come under the head either of
differences of internal pressure, or of lack of homogeneity or
isotropy in the surface itself<a class="afnanch" href="#fn296" id="fnanch296">296</a>.
<span class="xxpn" id="p242">{242}</span></p>

<p>Our full formula of equi­lib­rium, or equation to an elastic
surface, is <i>P</i>
=&#x202f;<i>p&#xfeff;<sub>e</sub></i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;(<i>T&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;R</i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;<i>T&#xfeff;′&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;R&#xfeff;′</i>), where <i>P</i> is the internal
pressure, <i>p&#xfeff;<sub>e</sub></i> any extraneous pressure normal to the surface, <i>R</i>, <i>R&#xfeff;′</i>
the radii of curvature at a point, and <i>T</i>, <i>T&#xfeff;′</i>, the cor­re­spon­ding
tensions, normal to one another, of the envelope.</p>

<p>Now in any given form which we are seeking to account for,
<i>R</i>, <i>R&#xfeff;′</i> are known quantities; but all the other factors of the equation
are unknown and subject to enquiry. And somehow or other, by
this formula, we must account for the form of any solitary cell
whatsoever (provided always that it be not formed by successive
stages of solidification), the cylindrical cell of Spirogyra, the
ellipsoidal yeast-cell, or (as we shall see in another chapter) the
shape of the egg of any bird. In using this formula hitherto, we
have taken it in a simplified form, that is to say we have made
several limiting assumptions. We have assumed that <i>P</i> was
simply the uniform hydrostatic pressure, equal in all directions,
of a body of liquid; we have assumed that the tension <i>T</i> was
simply due to surface-tension in a homogeneous liquid film, and
was therefore equal in all directions, so that <i>T</i>
=&#x202f;<i>T&#xfeff;′</i>; and we have
only dealt with surfaces, or parts of a surface, where extraneous
pressure, <i>p&#xfeff;<sub>n</sub></i>, was non-existent. Now in the case of a bird’s egg,
the external pressure <i>p&#xfeff;<sub>n</sub></i>, that is to say the pressure exercised by
the walls of the oviduct, will be found to be a very important
factor; but in the case of the yeast-cell or the Spirogyra, wholly
immersed in water, no such external pressure comes into play.
We are accordingly left, in such cases as these last, with two
hypotheses, namely that the departure from a spherical form is due
to inequalities in the internal pressure <i>P</i>, or else to inequalities in
the tension <i>T</i>, that is to say to a difference between <i>T</i> and <i>T&#xfeff;′</i>.
In other words, it is theoretically possible that the oval form of
a yeast-cell is due to a greater internal pressure, a greater
“tendency to grow,” in the direction of the longer axis of the
ellipse, or alternatively, that with equal and symmetrical tendencies
to growth there is associated a difference of
external resistance in <span class="xxpn" id="p243">{243}</span>
respect of the tension of the cell-wall. Now the former hypothesis
is not impossible; the protoplasm is far from being a perfect fluid;
it is the seat of various internal forces, sometimes manifestly
polar; and accordingly it is quite possible that the internal
forces, osmotic and other, which lead to an increase of the content
of the cell and are manifested in pressure outwardly directed
upon its wall may be unsymmetrical, and such as to lead to a
deformation of what would otherwise be a simple sphere. But
while this hypothesis is not impossible, it is not very easy of
acceptance. The protoplasm, though not a perfect fluid, has yet
on the whole the properties of a fluid; within the small compass
of the cell there is little room for the development of unsymmetrical
pressures; and, in such a case as Spirogyra, where a large part of
the cavity is filled by a fluid and watery cell-sap, the conditions
are still more obviously those under which a uniform hydrostatic
pressure is to be expected. But in variations of <i>T</i>, that is to say
of the specific surface-tension per unit area, we have an ample
field for all the various deformations with which we shall have to
deal. Our condition now is, that (<i>T&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;R</i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;<i>T&#xfeff;′&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;R&#xfeff;′</i>)
=&#x202f;a constant; but
it no longer follows, though it may still often be the case, that this
will represent a surface of absolute minimal area. As soon as <i>T</i>
and <i>T&#xfeff;′</i> become unequal, it is obvious that we are no longer dealing
with a perfectly liquid surface film; but its departure from a
perfect fluidity may be of all degrees, from that of a slight non-isotropic
viscosity to the state of a firm elastic membrane<a class="afnanch" href="#fn297" id="fnanch297">297</a>.
And
it matters little whether this viscosity or semi-rigidity be manifested
in the self-same layer which is still a part of the protoplasm
of the cell, or in a layer which is completely differentiated into a
distinct and separate membrane. As soon as, by secretion or
“adsorption,” the molecular constitution of the surface layer is
altered, it is clearly conceivable that the alteration, or the secondary
chemical changes which follow it, may be such as to produce an
anisotropy, and to render the molecular forces less capable in
one direction than another of exerting that contractile force by
which they are striving to reduce to an
absolute minimum the <span class="xxpn" id="p244">{244}</span>
surface area of the cell. A slight inequality in two opposite
directions will produce the ellipsoid cell, and a very great inequality
will give rise to the cylindrical cell<a class="afnanch" href="#fn298" id="fnanch298">298</a>.</p>

<p>I take it therefore, that the cylindrical cell of Spirogyra, or
any other cylindrical cell which grows in freedom from any
manifest external restraint, has assumed that particular form
simply by reason of the molecular constitution of its developing
surface-membrane; and that this molecular constitution was
anisotropous, in such a way as to render extension easier in one
direction than another.</p>

<p>Such a lack of homogeneity or of isotropy, in the cell-wall is
often rendered visible, especially in plant-cells, in various ways,
in the form of concentric lamellae, annular and spiral striations,
and the like.</p>

<p>But this phenomenon, while it brings about a certain departure
from complete symmetry, is still compatible with, and coexistent
with, many of the phenomena which we have seen to be associated
with surface-tension. The symmetry of tensions still leaves the
cell a solid of revolution, and its surface is still a surface of equi­lib­rium.
The fluid pressure within the cylinder still causes the
film or membrane which caps its ends to be of a spherical form.
And in the young cell, where the surface pellicle is absent or but
little differentiated, as for instance in the oögonium of Achlya,
or in the young zygospore of Spirogyra, we always see the tendency
of the entire structure towards a spherical form reasserting itself:
unless, as in the latter case, it be overcome by direct compression
within the cylindrical mother-cell. Moreover, in those cases
where the adult filament consists of cylindrical cells, we see that
the young, germinating spore, at first spherical, very soon assumes
with growth an elliptical or ovoid form: the direct result of an
incipient anisotropy of its envelope, which when more developed
will convert the ovoid into a cylinder. We may also notice that
a truly cylindrical cell is comparatively rare; for in most cases,
what we call a cylindrical cell shews a distinct bulging of its sides;
it is not truly a cylinder, but a portion of a
spheroid or ellipsoid. <span class="xxpn" id="p245">{245}</span></p>

<p>Unicellular organisms in general, including the protozoa, the
unicellular cryptogams, the various bacteria, and the free,
isolated cells, spores, ova, etc. of higher organisms, are referable
for the most part to a very small number of typical forms; but
besides a certain number of others which may be so referable,
though obscurely, there are obviously many others in which
either no symmetry is to be recognized, or in which the form is
clearly not one of equi­lib­rium. Among these latter we have
Amoeba itself, and all manner of amoeboid organisms, and also
many curiously shaped cells, such as the Trypanosomes and various
other aberrant Infusoria. We shall return to the consideration of
these; but in the meanwhile it will suffice to say that, as their
surfaces are not equi­lib­rium-surfaces, so neither are the living
cells themselves in any stable equi­lib­rium. On the contrary, they
are in continual flux and movement, each portion of the surface
constantly changing its form, and passing from one phase to
another of an equi­lib­rium which is never stable for more than
a moment. The former class, which rest in stable equi­lib­rium,
must fall (as we have seen) into two classes,—those whose equi­lib­rium
arises from liquid surface-tension alone, and those in
whose conformation some other pressure or restraint has been
superimposed upon ordinary surface-tension.</p>

<p>To the fact that these little organisms belong to an order of
magnitude in which form is mainly, if not wholly, conditioned and
controlled by molecular forces, is due the limited range of
forms which they actually exhibit. These forms vary according
to varying physical conditions. Sometimes they do so in so regular
and orderly a way that we instinctively explain them merely as
“phases of a life-history,” and leave physical properties and
physical causation alone: but many of their variations of form we
treat as exceptional, abnormal, decadent or morbid, and are apt
to pass these over in neglect, while we give our attention to what
we suppose to be the typical or “char­ac­ter­is­tic” form or attitude.
In the case of the smallest organisms, the bacteria, micrococci,
and so forth, the range of form is especially limited, owing to their
minuteness, the powerful pressure which their highly curved
surfaces exert, and the comparatively homogeneous nature of their
substance. But within their narrow range
of possible diversity <span class="xxpn" id="p246">{246}</span>
these minute organisms are protean in their changes of form.
A certain species will not only change its shape from stage to
stage of its little “cycle” of life; but it will be remarkably different
in outward form according to the circumstances under which we
find it, or the histological treatment to which we submit it. Hence
the pathological student, commencing the study of bacteriology,
is early warned to pay little heed to differences of <i>form</i>, for purposes
of recognition or specific identification. Whatever grounds we
may have for attributing to these organisms a permanent or stable
specific identity (after the fashion of the higher plants and animals),
we can seldom safely do so on the ground of definite and always
recognisable <i>form</i>: we may</p>

to them a physiological (sometimes a “pathogenic”), rather than

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Among the Infusoria, we have a small number of forms whose
symmetry is distinctly spherical, for instance among the small
flagellate monads; but even these are seldom actually spherical
except when we see them in a non-flagellate and more or less
encysted or “resting” stage. In this condition, it need hardly be
remarked that the spherical form is common and general among
a great variety of unicellular organisms. When our little monad
developes a flagellum, that is in itself an indication of “polarity”
or symmetrical non-homogeneity of the cell;
and accordingly, we <span class="xxpn" id="p247">{247}</span>
usually see signs of an unequal tension of the membrane in the
neighbourhood of the base of the flagellum. Here the tension is
usually less than elsewhere, and the radius of curvature is accordingly
less: in other words that end of the cell is drawn out to a
tapering point (Fig. <a href="#fig73" title="go to Fig. 73">73</a>). But sometimes it is the other way, as
in Noctiluca, where the large flagellum springs from a depression
in the otherwise uniformly rounded cell. In this case the explanation
seems to lie in the many strands of radiating protoplasm
which converge upon this point, and may be supposed to keep it
relatively fixed by their viscosity, while the rest of the cell-surface
is free to expand (Fig. <a href="#fig74" title="go to Fig. 74">74</a>).</p>

<p>A very large number of Infusoria represent unduloids, or
portions of unduloids, and this type of surface appears and
reappears in a great variety of forms. The cups of the various
species of Vorticella (Fig. <a href="#fig75" title="go to Fig. 75">75</a>) are nothing in the world but a
beautiful series of unduloids, or partial unduloids, in every gradation
from a form that is all but cylindrical to one that is all but
a perfect sphere. These unduloids are not completely symmetrical,
but they are such unduloids as develop themselves when we
suspend an oil-globule between two unequal rings, or blow a
soap-bubble between two unequal pipes; for, just as in these
cases, the surface of our Vorticella bell finds its terminal supports,
on the one hand in its attachment to its narrow stalk, and on the
other in the thickened ring from which spring its circumoral cilia.
And here let me say, that a point or zone from which cilia arise
would seem always to have a peculiar relation to the surrounding
tensions. It usually forms a sharp salient, a prominent point
or ridge, as in our little monads of Fig. <a href="#fig73" title="go to Fig. 73">73</a>; shewing that,
in its formation, the surface tension had here locally diminished.
But if such a ridge or fillet consolidate in the least degree, it
becomes a source of strength, and a <i>point d’appui</i> for the adjacent
film. We shall deal with this point again in
the next chapter. <span class="xxpn" id="p248">{248}</span></p>

illustration of the contrast between the different
ways in which such a structure may be regarded
and interpreted. The teleological explanation is
that it is developed for the sake of protection, as a
domicile and shelter for the little organism within.
The mechanical explanation of the physicist (seeking
only after the “efficient,” and not the “final” cause), is
that it is <span class="xxpn" id="p249">{249}</span>

<p class="pcontinue">possible area which the circumstances
permitted; that in the present case, the symmetry and “freedom”
of the system permitted, and <i>ipso facto</i> caused, this surface
to be a surface of revolution; and that of the few surfaces of
revolution which, as being also surfaces <i>minimae areae</i>, were
available, the unduloid was manifestly the one permitted, and
<i>ipso facto</i> caused, by the dimensions of the organisms and
other circumstances of the case. And just as the thickness or
thinness of the pellicle was obviously a subordinate matter, a
mere matter of degree, so we also see that the actual outline
of this or that particular unduloid is also a very subordinate
matter, such as physico-chemical variants of a minute kind
would suffice to bring about; for between the various unduloids
which the various species of Vorticella represent, there
is no more real difference than that difference of ratio
or degree which exists between two circles of different
diameter, or two lines of unequal length. <span class="xxpn"
id="p250">{250}</span></p>

<p>In very many cases (of which Fig. <a href="#fig80" title="go to Fig. 80">80</a> is an example), we have
an unduloid form exhibited, not by a surrounding pellicle or shell,
but by the soft, protoplasmic body of a ciliated organism. In
such cases the form is mobile, and continually changes from one
to another unduloid contour, according to the movements of the
animal. We have here, apparently, to deal with an unstable
equi­lib­rium, and also sometimes with the more complicated
problem of “stream-lines,” as in the difficult problems suggested
by the form of a fish. But this whole class of cases, and of
problems, we can merely take note of in passing, for their treatment
is too hard for us.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>In considering such series of forms as the various unduloids
which we have just been regarding, we are brought sharply
up (as in the case of our Bacteria or Micrococci) against the biological
concept of organic <i>species</i>. In the intense clas­si­fi­ca­tory
activity of the last hundred years, it has come about that every
form which is apparently char­ac­ter­is­tic, that is to say which is
capable of being described or portrayed, and capable of being
recognised when met with again, has been recorded as a species,—for
we need not concern ourselves with the occasional discussions,
or individual opinions, as to whether such and such a form deserve
“specific rank,” or be “only a variety.” And this secular labour
is pursued in direct obedience to the precept of the <i>Systema
Naturae</i>,—“<i>ut sic in summa confusione rerum apparenti, summus
conspiciatur Naturae ordo</i>.” In like manner the physicist records,
and is entitled to record, his many hundred “species” of snow-crystals<a class="afnanch" href="#fn299" id="fnanch299">299</a>,
or of crystals of calcium carbonate. But regarding
these latter species, the physicist makes no assumptions: he
records them <i>simpliciter</i>, as specific “forms”; he notes, as best
he can, the circumstances (such as temperature or humidity)
under which they occur, in the hope of elucidating the conditions
determining their formation; but above all, he
does not introduce <span class="xxpn" id="p251">{251}</span>
the element of time, and of succession, or discuss their origin and
affiliation as an <i>historical</i> sequence of events. But in biology, the
term species carries with it many large, though often vague
assumptions. Though the doctrine or concept of the “permanence
of species” is dead and gone, yet a certain definite value, or sort
of quasi-permanency, is still connoted by the term. Thus if a tiny
foraminiferal shell, a Lagena for instance, be found living to-day,
and a shell in­dis­tin­guish­able from it to the eye be found fossil
in the Chalk or some other remote geological formation, the
assumption is deemed legitimate that that species has “survived,”
and has handed down its minute specific character or characters,
from generation to generation, unchanged for untold myriads of
years<a class="afnanch" href="#fn300" id="fnanch300">300</a>.
Or if the ancient forms be like to, rather than identical
with the recent, we still assume an unbroken descent, accompanied
by the hereditary transmission of common characters and progressive
variations. And if two identical forms be discovered at
the ends of the earth, still (with occasional slight reservations on
the score of possible “homoplasy”), we build hypotheses on this
fact of identity, taking it for granted that the two appertain to
a common stock, whose dispersal in space must somehow be
accounted for, its route traced, its epoch determined, and its
causes discussed or discovered. In short, the naturalist admits
no exception to the rule that a “natural clas­si­fi­ca­tion” can only
be a <i>genealogical</i> one, nor ever doubts that “<i>The fact that we are
able to classify organisms at all in accordance with the structural
char­ac­teris­tics which they present, is due to the fact of their being
related by descent</i><a class="afnanch" href="#fn301" id="fnanch301">301</a>.”
But this great generalisation is apt in my
opinion, to carry us too far. It may be safe and sure and helpful
and illuminating when we apply it to such complex entities,—such
thousand-fold resultants of the combination and permutation
of many variable characters,—as a horse, a lion or an eagle;
but (to my mind) it has a very different look, and a far less firm
foundation, when we attempt to extend it to minute organisms
whose specific characters are few and simple,
whose simplicity <span class="xxpn" id="p252">{252}</span>
becomes much more manifest when we regard it from the point
of view of physical and math­e­mat­i­cal description and analysis,
and whose form is referable, or (to say the least of it) is very
largely referable, to the direct and immediate action of a particular
physical force. When we come to deal with the minute skeletons
of the Radiolaria we shall again find ourselves dealing with endless
modifications of form, in which it becomes still more difficult to
discern, or to apply, the guiding principle of affiliation or <i>genealogy</i>.</p>

<p>Among the more aberrant forms of Infusoria is a little species
known as <i>Trichodina pedicidus</i>, a parasite on the Hydra, or fresh-water
polype (Fig. <a href="#fig81" title="go to Fig. 81">81</a>.) This Trichodina has the form of a more or less
flattened circular disc, with a ring
of cilia around both its upper and
lower margins. The salient ridge
from which these cilia spring may
be taken, as we have already said,
to play the part of a strengthening
“fillet.” The circular base of the
animal is flattened, in contact with
the flattened surface of the Hydra
over which it creeps, and the opposite,
upper surface may be flattened nearly to a plane, or may at
other times appear slightly convex or slightly concave. The sides
of the little organism are contracted, forming a symmetrical
equatorial groove between the upper and lower discs; and, on
account of the minute size of the animal and its constant
movements, we cannot submit the curvature of this concavity to
measurement, nor recognise by the eye its exact contour. But
it is evident that the conditions are precisely similar to those
described on p. <a href="#p223" title="go to pg. 223">223</a>, where we were considering the conditions
of stability of the catenoid. And it is further evident that, when
the upper disc is actually plane, the equatorial groove is strictly
a catenoid surface of revolution; and when on the other hand it
is depressed, then the equatorial groove will tend to assume
the form of a nodoidal surface.<br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<p>Another curious type is the flattened spiral
of <i>Dinenympha</i><a class="afnanch" href="#fn302" id="fnanch302">302</a>
<span class="xxpn" id="p253">{253}</span>
which reminds us of the cylindrical spiral of a Spirillum among
the bacteria. In Dinenympha we have a symmetrical figure, whose
two opposite surfaces each constitute a surface of constant mean
curvature; it is evidently a figure of equi­lib­rium under certain
special conditions of restraint. The cylindrical coil of the
Spirillum, on the other hand, is a surface of constant mean curvature,
and therefore of equi­lib­rium, as truly, and in the same sense,
as the cylinder itself.</p>

 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 82. <i>Dinenympha gracilis</i>, Leidy.</div></div>

<p>A very curious conformation is that of the vibratile “collar,”
found in Codosiga and the other “Choanoflagellates,” and which
we also meet with in the “collar-cells” which line the interior
cavities of a sponge. Such collar-cells are always very minute,
and the collar is constituted of a very delicate film, which
shews an undulatory or rippling motion. It is a surface of
revolution, and as it maintains itself in equi­lib­rium (though a
somewhat unstable and fluctuating one), it must be, under the
restricted circumstances of its case, a surface of minimal area.
But it is not so easy to see what these special circumstances are;
and it is obvious that the collar, if left to itself,
must at once <span class="xxpn" id="p254">{254}</span>
contract downwards towards its base, and become confluent with</p>

<div class="dleft dwth-h" id="fig83">
<img src="images/i254.png" width="201" height="437" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 83.</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">the general surface of the cell; for it
has no longitudinal supports and no strengthening ring at
its periphery. But in all these collar-cells, there stands
within the annulus of the collar a large and powerful cilium
or flagellum, in constant movement; and by the action of
this flagellum, and doubtless in part also by the intrinsic
vibrations of the collar itself, there is set up a constant
steady current in the surrounding water, whose direction would
seem to be such that it passes up the outside of the collar,
down its inner side, and out in the middle in the direction of
the flagellum; and there is a distinct eddy, in which foreign
particles tend to be caught, around the peripheral margin of
the collar. When the cell dies, that is to say when motion
ceases, the collar immediately shrivels away and disappears.
It is notable, by the way, that the edge of this little mobile
cup is always smooth, never notched or lobed as in the cases
we have discussed on p. <a href="#p236" title="go to pg. 236">236</a>: this latter condition being
the outcome of a definite instability, marking the close of
a period of equi­lib­rium; while in the vibratile collar of
Codosiga the equi­lib­rium, such as it is, is being constantly
renewed and perpetuated like that of a juggler’s pole, by the
motions of the system. I take it that, somehow, its existence
(in a state of partial equi­lib­rium) is due to the current
motions, and to the traction exerted upon it through the
friction of the stream which is constantly passing by. I think,
in short, that it is formed very much in the same way as the
cup-like ring of streaming ribbons, which we see fluttering
and vibrating in the air-current of a ventilating fan.<br
class="brclrfix" /></p>

<p>It is likely enough, however, that a different and
much better explanation may yet be found; and if we turn
once more to Mr Worthington’s <i>Study of Splashes</i>, we may
find a curious suggestion of analogy in the beautiful
craters encircling a central jet (as the collar of Codosiga
encircles the flagellum), which we see produced in the
later stages of the splash of a pebble<a class="afnanch"
href="#fn303" id="fnanch303">303</a>. <span class="xxpn"
id="p255">{255}</span></p>

<p>Among the Foraminifera we have an immense variety of forms,
which, in the light of surface tension and of the principle of
minimal area, are capable of explanation and of reduction to a
small number of char­ac­ter­is­tic types. Many of the Foraminifera
are composite structures, formed by the successive imposition of
cell upon cell, and these we shall deal with later on; let us glance
here at the simpler conformations exhibited by the single chambered
or “monothalamic” genera, and perhaps one or two of the
simplest composites.</p>

<p>We begin with forms, like Astrorhiza (Fig. <a href="#fig219" title="go to Fig. 219">219</a>,
p. 464), which
are in a high degree irregular, and end with others which manifest a
perfect and math­e­mat­i­cal regularity. The broad difference between
these two types is that the former are characterised, like Amoeba,
by a variable surface tension, and consequently by unstable equi­lib­rium;
but the strong contrast between these and the regular forms
is bridged over by various transition-stages, or differences of degree.
Indeed, as in all other Rhizopods, the very fact of the emission of
pseudopodia, which reach their highest development in this group
of animals, is a sign of unstable surface-equi­lib­rium; and we must
therefore consider that those forms which indicate symmetry and
equi­lib­rium in their shells have secreted these during periods when
rest and uniformity of surface conditions alternated with the
phases of pseudopodial activity. The irregular forms are in
almost all cases arenaceous, that is to say they have no solid shells
formed by steady adsorptive secretion, but only a looser covering
of sand grains with which the protoplasmic body has come in
contact and cohered. Sometimes, as in Ramulina, we have a
calcareous shell combined with irregularity of form; but here we
can easily see a partial and as it were a broken regularity, the
regular forms of sphere and cylinder being repeated in various
parts of the ramified mass. When we look more closely at the
arenaceous forms, we find that the same thing is true of them;
they represent, either in whole or part, approximations to the form
of surfaces of equi­lib­rium, spheres, cylinders and so forth. In
Aschemonella we have a precise replica of the calcareous Ramulina;
and in Astrorhiza itself, in the forms distinguished by naturalists
as <i>A. crassatina</i>, what is described as
the “subsegmented interior<a class="afnanch" href="#fn304" id="fnanch304">304</a>”
<span class="xxpn" id="p256">{256}</span>
seems to shew the natural, physical tendency of the long semifluid
cylinder of protoplasm to contract, at its limit of stability, into
unduloid constrictions, as a step towards the breaking up into
separate spheres: the completion of which process is restrained or
prevented by the rigidity and friction of the arenaceous covering.</p>

 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 84. Various species of <i>Lagena</i>.

<p>Passing to the typical, calcareous-shelled Foraminifera, we have
the most symmetrical of all possible types in the perfect sphere of
Orbulina; this is a pelagic organism, whose floating habitat places
it in a position of perfect symmetry towards all external forces.
Save for one or two other forms which are also spherical, or
ap­prox­i­mate­ly so, like Thurammina, the rest of the monothalamic
calcareous Foraminifera are all comprised by naturalists within
the genus Lagena. This large and varied genus consists of “flask-shaped”
shells, whose surface is simply that of an unduloid, or
more frequently, like that of a flask itself, an unduloid combined
with a portion of a sphere. We do not
know the circumstances <span class="xxpn" id="p257">{257}</span>
under which the shell of Lagena is formed, nor the nature of the
force by which, during its formation, the surface is stretched out
into the unduloid form; but we may be pretty sure that it is
suspended vertically in the sea, that is to say in a position of
symmetry as regards its vertical axis, about which the unduloid
surface of revolution is symmetrically formed. At the same time
we have other types of the same shell in which the form is more
or less flattened; and these are doubtless the cases in which such
symmetry of position was not present, or was replaced by a broader,
lateral contact with the surface pellicle<a class="afnanch" href="#fn305" id="fnanch305">305</a>.</p>

<div class="dctr01" id="fig85">
<img src="images/i257.png" width="800" height="321" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 85. (After Darling.)</div></div>

<p>While Orbulina is a simple spherical drop, Lagena suggests to
our minds a “hanging drop,” drawn out to a long and slender
neck by its own weight, aided by the viscosity of the material.
Indeed the various hanging drops, such as Mr C. R. Darling shews
us, are the most beautiful and perfect unduloids, with spherical
ends, that it is possible to conceive. A suitable liquid, a little
denser than water and incapable of mixing with it (such as
ethyl benzoate), is poured on a surface of
water. It spreads <span class="xxpn" id="p258">{258}</span>
over the surface and gradually forms a hanging drop, ap­prox­i­mate­ly
hemispherical; but as more liquid is added the drop
sinks or rather grows downwards, still adhering to the surface
film; and the balance of forces between gravity and surface
tension results in the unduloid contour, as the increasing weight
of the drop tends to stretch it out and finally break it in two.
At the moment of rupture, by the way, a tiny droplet is formed
in the attenuated neck, such as we described in the normal
division of a cylindrical thread (p. <a href="#p233" title="go to pg. 233">233</a>).</p>

<div class="psmprnt3">
<p>To pass to a much more highly organised class of animals,
we find the unduloid beautifully exemplified in the little
flask-shaped shells of certain Pteropod mollusca, e.g.
Cuvierina<a class="afnanch" href="#fn306" id="fnanch306">306</a>.
Here again the symmetry of the figure would
at once lead us to suspect that the creature lived in a
position of symmetry to the surrounding forces, as for
instance if it floated in the ocean in an erect position,
that is to say with its long axis coincident with the
direction of gravity; and this we know to be actually the
mode of life of the little Pteropod.</p>
</div><!--psmprnt3-->

<p>Many species of Lagena are complicated and beautified by a
pattern, and some by the superaddition to the shell of plane
extensions or “wings.” These latter give a secondary, bilateral
symmetry to the little shell, and are strongly suggestive of a
phase or period of growth in which it lay horizontally on the
surface, instead of hanging vertically from the surface-film: in
which, that is to say, it was a floating and not a hanging
drop. The pattern is of two kinds. Sometimes it consists
of a sort of fine reticulation, with rounded or more or
less hexagonal interspaces: in other cases it is produced by a
symmetrical series of ridges or folds, usually longitudinal, on the
body of the flask-shaped cell, but occasionally transversely arranged
upon the narrow neck. The reticulated and folded patterns we
may consider separately. The netted pattern is very similar to the
wrinkled surface of a dried pea, or to the more regular wrinkled
patterns upon many other seeds and even pollen-grains. If a
spherical body after developing a “skin” begin to shrink a little,
and if the skin have so far lost its elasticity as to be unable to
keep pace with the shrinkage of the inner mass, it will tend to
fold or wrinkle; and if the shrinkage be uniform, and the elasticity
and flexibility of the skin be also uniform,
then the amount of <span class="xxpn" id="p259">{259}</span>
folding will be uniformly distributed over the surface. Little
concave depressions will appear, regularly interspaced, and
separated by convex folds. The little concavities being of equal
size (unless the system be otherwise perturbed) each one will tend
to be surrounded by six others; and when the process has reached
its limit, the intermediate boundary-walls, or raised folds, will be
found converted into a regular pattern of hexagons.</p>

<p>But the analogy of the mechanical wrinkling of the coat of
a seed is but a rough and distant one; for we are evidently dealing
with molecular rather than with mechanical forces. In one of
Darling’s experiments, a little heavy tar-oil is dropped onto a
saucer of water, over which it spreads in a thin film showing
beautiful interference colours after the fashion of those of a soap-bubble.
Presently tiny holes appear in the film, which gradually
increase in size till they form a cellular pattern or honeycomb,
the oil gathering together in the meshes or walls of the cellular
net. Some action of this sort is in all probability at work in a
surface-film of protoplasm covering the shell. As a physical
phenomenon the actions involved are by no means fully understood,
but surface-tension, diffusion and cohesion doubtless play
their respective parts therein<a class="afnanch" href="#fn307" id="fnanch307">307</a>.
The very perfect cellular patterns
obtained by Leduc (to which we shall have occasion to refer in
a subsequent chapter) are diffusion patterns on a larger scale, but
not essentially different.</p>

<div class="dleft dwth-g" id="fig86">
<img src="images/i260.png" width="263" height="246" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 86.</div></div>

<p>The folded or pleated pattern is doubtless to be explained, in
a general way, by the shrinkage of a
surface-film under certain <span class="xxpn" id="p260">{260}</span>
conditions of viscous or frictional restraint. A case which (as it
seems to me) is closely analogous to that of our foraminiferal
shells is described by Quincke<a class="afnanch" href="#fn308" id="fnanch308">308</a>,
who let a film of albumin or of
resin set and harden upon a surface of quicksilver, and found
that the little solid pellicle had been
thrown into a pattern of symmetrical
folds. If the surface thus thrown into
folds be that of a cylinder, or any other
figure with one principal axis of symmetry,
such as an ellipsoid or unduloid,
the direction of the folds will tend to
be related to the axis of symmetry,
and we might expect accordingly to
find regular longitudinal, or regular transverse wrinkling. Now
as a matter of fact we almost invariably find in the Lagena
the former condition: that is to say, in our ellipsoid or unduloid
cell, the puckering takes the form of the vertical fluting on
a column, rather than that of the transverse pleating of an
accordion. And further, there is often a tendency for such
longitudinal flutings to be more or less localised at the end of the
ellipsoid, or in the region where the unduloid merges into its
spherical base. In this latter region we often meet with a regular
series of short longitudinal folds, as we do in the forms of Lagena
denominated <i>L. semistriata</i>. All these various forms of surface
can be imitated, or rather can be precisely reproduced, by the art
of the glass-blower<a class="afnanch" href="#fn309" id="fnanch309">309</a>.
<br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<p>Furthermore, they remind one, in a striking way, of the
regular ribs or flutings in the film or sheath which splashes up to
envelop a smooth ball which has been dropped into a liquid, as
Mr Worthington has so beautifully shewn<a class="afnanch" href="#fn310" id="fnanch310">310</a>.
<span class="xxpn" id="p261">{261}</span></p>

<div class="dmaths">
<p>In Mr Worthington’s experiment, there appears to
be something of the nature of a viscous drag in the
surface-pellicle; but whatever be the actual cause of variation
of tension, it is not difficult to see that there must be
in general a tendency towards <i>longitudinal</i> puckering
or “fluting” in the case of a thin-walled cylindrical
or other elongated body, rather than a tendency towards
transverse puckering, or “pleating.” For let us suppose
that some change takes place involving an increase of
surface-tension in some small area of the curved wall, and
leading therefore to an increase of pressure: that is to
say let <i>T</i> become <i>T</i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;<i>t</i>, and <i>P</i> become
<i>P</i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;<i>p</i>. Our new equation of equi­lib­rium, then,
in place of <i>P</i>
=&#x202f;<i>T&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;r</i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;<i>T&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;r&#xfeff;′</i>

<p class="pcontinue">Therefore, in order to produce the small increment of pressure <i>p</i>,
it is easier to do so by increasing <i>t&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;r</i> than <i>t&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;r&#xfeff;′</i>; that is to say, the
easier way is to alter, or diminish <i>r</i>. And the same will hold good
if the tension and pressure be diminished instead of increased.</p>
</div><!--dmaths-->

<p>This is as much as to say that, when corrugation or “rippling”
of the walls takes place owing to small changes of surface-tension,
and consequently of pressure, such corrugation is more likely to
take place in the plane of <i>r</i>,—that is to say, <i>in the plane of greatest
curvature</i>. And it follows that in such a figure as an ellipsoid,
wrinkling will be most likely to take place not only in a longitudinal
direction but near the extremities of the figure, that is to say again
in the region of greatest curvature.</p>

<p>The longitudinal wrinkling of the flask-shaped bodies of our
Lagenae, and of the more or less cylindrical cells of many other
Foraminifera (Fig. <a href="#fig87" title="go to Fig. 87">87</a>), is in complete accord with the above theoretical
con­si­de­ra­tions; but nevertheless, we soon find that our result
is not a general one, but is defined by certain limiting conditions,
and is accordingly subject to what are, at first sight, important
exceptions. For instance, when we turn to the narrow neck of
the Lagena we see at once that our theory no
longer holds; for <span class="xxpn" id="p262">{262}</span>
the wrinkling which was invariably longitudinal in the body of
the cell is as invariably transverse in the narrow neck. The reason
for the difference is not far to seek. The conditions in the neck
are very different from those in the expanded portion of the cell:
the main difference being that the thickness of the wall is no longer
insignificant, but is of considerable magnitude as compared with
the diameter, or circumference, of the neck. We must accordingly
take it into account in considering the <i>bending moments</i> at any
point in this region of the shell-wall. And it is at once obvious
that, in any portion of the narrow neck, <i>flexure</i> of a wall in a
transverse direction will be very difficult, while flexure in a
longitudinal direction will be comparatively easy; just as, in the
case of a long narrow strip of iron, we may easily bend it into
folds running transversely to its long axis, but not the other way.
The manner in which our little Lagena-shell tends to fold or wrinkle,
longitudinally in its wider part, and transversely or annularly in
its narrow neck, is thus completely and easily explained.</p>

<p>An identical phenomenon is apt to occur in the little flask-shaped
gonangia, or reproductive capsules, of some of the hydroid
zoophytes. In the annexed drawings of these gonangia in two
species of Campanularia, we see that in one case
the little vesicle <span class="xxpn" id="p263">{263}</span>
has the flask-shaped or unduloid configuration of a Lagena; and
here the walls of the flask are longitudinally fluted, just after the
manner we have witnessed in the latter genus. But in the other
Campanularian the vesicles are long, narrow and tubular, and here
a transverse folding or pleating takes the place of the longitudinally
fluted pattern. And the very form of the folds or pleats is
enough to suggest that we are not dealing here with a simple
phenomenon of surface-tension, but with a condition in which
surface-tension and <i>stiffness</i> are both present, and play their
parts in the resultant form.</p>

<p>Passing from the solitary flask-shaped cell of Lagena, we have,
in another series of forms, a constricted cylinder, or succession
of unduloids; such as are represented in Fig. <a href="#fig89" title="go to Fig. 89">89</a>, illustrating
certain species of Nodosaria, Rheophax and Sagrina. In some of
these cases, and certainly in that of the arenaceous genus Rheophax,
we have to do with the ordinary phenomenon of a segmenting or
partially segmenting cylinder. But in others, the structure is
not developed out of a continuous protoplasmic cylinder, but as
we can see by examining the interior of the shell, it has been
formed in successive stages, beginning with a simple unduloid
“Lagena,” about whose neck, after its solidification, another drop
of protoplasm accumulated, and in turn assumed the unduloid,
or lagenoid, form. The chains of
interconnected bubbles which <span class="xxpn" id="p264">{264}</span>
Morey and Draper made many years ago of melted resin are a
very similar if not identical phenomenon<a class="afnanch" href="#fn311" id="fnanch311">311</a>.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>There now remain for our consideration, among the Protozoa,
the great oceanic group of the Radiolaria, and the little group of
their freshwater allies, the Heliozoa. In nearly all these forms we
have this specific chemical difference from the Foraminifera, that
when they secrete, as they generally do secrete, a hard skeleton,
it is composed of silica instead of lime. These organisms and the
various beautiful and highly complicated skeletal fabrics which
they develop give us many interesting illustrations of physical
phenomena, among which the manifestations of surface-tension
are very prominent. But the chief phenomena connected with
their skeletons we shall deal with in another place, under the head
of spicular concretions.</p>

<p>In a simple and typical Heliozoan, such as the Sun-animalcule,
<i>Actinophrys sol</i>, we have a “drop” of protoplasm, contracted by
its surface tension into a spherical form. Within the heterogeneous
protoplasmic mass are more fluid portions, and at the surface
which separates these from the surrounding protoplasm a similar
surface tension causes them also to assume the form of spherical
“vacuoles,” which in reality are little clear drops within the big
one; unless indeed they become numerous and closely packed, in
which case, instead of isolated spheres or droplets they will
constitute a “froth,” their mutual pressures and tensions giving
rise to regular con­fi­gur­a­tions such as we shall study in the next
chapter. One or more of such clear spaces may be what is called
a “contractile vacuole”: that is to say, a droplet whose surface
tension is in unstable equi­lib­rium and is apt to vanish altogether,
so that the definite outline of the vacuole suddenly disappears<a class="afnanch" href="#fn312" id="fnanch312">312</a>.
Again, within the protoplasm are one or more nuclei, whose own
surface tension (at the surface between the nucleus and the
surrounding protoplasm), has drawn them in
turn into the shape <span class="xxpn" id="p265">{265}</span>
of spheres. Outwards through the protoplasm, and stretching far
beyond the spherical surface of the cell, there run stiff linear
threads of modified or differentiated protoplasm, replaced or
reinforced in some cases by delicate siliceous needles. In either
case we know little or nothing about the forces which lead to their
production, and we do not hide our ignorance when we ascribe
their development to a “radial polarisation” of the cell. In the
case of the protoplasmic filament, we may (if we seek for a
hypothesis), suppose that it is somehow comparable to a viscid
stream, or “liquid vein,” thrust or squirted out from the body of
the cell. But when it is once formed, this long and comparatively
rigid filament is separated by a distinct surface from the neighbouring
protoplasm, that is to say from the more fluid surface-protoplasm
of the cell; and the latter begins to creep up the
filament, just as water would creep up the interior of a glass tube,
or the sides of a glass rod immersed in the liquid. It is the simple
case of a balance between three separate tensions: (1) that between
the filament and the adjacent protoplasm, (2) that between the
filament and the adjacent water, and (3) that between the water
and the protoplasm. Calling these tensions respectively
<i>T&#xfeff;<sub>fp</sub></i>, <i>T&#xfeff;<sub>fw</sub></i>,
and <i>T&#xfeff;<sub>wp</sub></i>, equi­lib­rium will be attained when the angle of contact
between the fluid protoplasm and the filament is such that
cos&#x202f;α
=&#x202f;(<i>T&#xfeff;<sub>fw</sub></i>&#x202f;−&#x202f;<i>T&#xfeff;<sub>wp</sub></i>)&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>T&#xfeff;<sub>fp</sub></i>.
It is evident in this case that the angle is
a very small one. The precise form of the curve is somewhat
different from that which, under ordinary circumstances, is assumed
by a liquid which creeps up a solid surface, as water in contact
with air creeps up a surface of glass; the difference being due to
the fact that here, owing to the density of the protoplasm being
practically identical with that of the surrounding medium, the
whole system is practically immune from gravity. Under normal
circumstances the curve is part of the “elastic curve” by which
that surface of revolution is generated which we have called,
after Plateau, the nodoid; but in the present case it is apparently
a catenary. Whatever curve it be, it obviously forms a surface
of revolution around the filament.</p>

<p>Since the attraction exercised by this surface tension is
symmetrical around the filament, the latter will
be pulled equally <span class="xxpn" id="p266">{266}</span>
in all directions; in other words it will tend to be set normally
to the surface of the sphere, that is to say radiating directly
outwards from the centre. If the distance between two adjacent
filaments be considerable, the curve will simply meet the filament
at the angle α already referred to; but if they be sufficiently near
together, we shall have a continuous catenary curve forming a
hanging loop between one filament and the other. And when this
is so, and the radial filaments are more or less symmetrically
interspaced, we may have a beautiful system of honeycomb-like
depressions over the surface of the organism, each cell of the
honeycomb having a strictly defined geometric configuration.</p>

<p>In the simpler Radiolaria, the spherical form of the entire
organism is equally well-marked; and here, as also in the more
complicated Heliozoa (such as Actinosphaerium), the organism is
differentiated into several distinct layers, each boundary surface
tending to be spherical, and so constituting sphere within sphere.
One of these layers at least is close packed with vacuoles, forming
an “alveolar meshwork,” with the con­fi­gur­a­tions of which we shall
attempt in another chapter to correlate the char­ac­ter­is­tic structure
of certain complex types of skeleton.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>An exceptional form of cell, but a beautiful manifestation of
surface-tension (or so I take it to be), occurs in Trypanosomes, those
tiny parasites of the blood that are associated with sleeping-sickness
and many other grave or dire maladies. These tiny
organisms consist of elongated solitary cells down one side of which
runs a very delicate frill, or “undulating membrane,” the free
edge of which is seen to be slightly thickened, and
the whole of <span class="xxpn" id="p267">{267}</span>
which undergoes rhythmical and beautiful wavy movements.
When certain Trypanosomes are artificially cultivated (for instance
<i>T. rotatorium</i>, from the blood of the frog), phases of growth are
witnessed in which the organism has no undulating membrane,
but possesses a long cilium or “flagellum,” springing from near
the front end, and exceeding the whole body in length<a class="afnanch" href="#fn313" id="fnanch313">313</a>.
Again,
in <i>T. lewisii</i>, when it reproduces by “multiple fission,” the
products of this division are likewise devoid of an undulating
membrane, but are provided with a long free flagellum<a class="afnanch" href="#fn314" id="fnanch314">314</a>.
It is
a plausible assumption to suppose that, as the flagellum waves
about, it comes to lie near and parallel to the body of the cell,
and that the frill or undulating membrane is formed by the clear,
fluid protoplasm of the surface layer springing up in a film to run
up and along the flagellum, just as a soap-film would be formed in
similar circumstances.</p>

 B, <i>Trichomastix serpentis</i>, Dobell; C, <i>Trichomonas
 angusta</i>, Alexeieff. (After Kofoid.)</div></div>

<p>This mode of formation of the undulating membrane or frill
appears to be confirmed by the appearances
shewn in Fig. <a href="#fig91" title="go to Fig. 91">91</a>. <span class="xxpn" id="p268">{268}</span>
Here we have three little organisms closely allied to the ordinary
Trypanosomes, of which one, Trichomastix (<i>B</i>), possesses four
flagella, and the other two, Trichomonas, apparently three only:
the two latter possess the frill, which is lacking in the first<a class="afnanch" href="#fn315" id="fnanch315">315</a>.
But
it is impossible to doubt that when the frill is present (as in <i>A</i> and
<i>C</i>), its outer edge is constituted by the apparently missing flagellum
(<i>a</i>), which has become <i>attached</i> to the body of the creature at the
point <i>c</i>, near its posterior end; and all along its course, the superficial
protoplasm has been drawn out into a film, between the
flagellum (<i>a</i>) and the adjacent surface or edge of the body (<i>b</i>).</p>

un­du­la­tory mem­brane of a Try­pa­no­some. (After D. L.
Mac­kin­non.)</div></div>

<p>Moreover, this mode of formation has been ac­tual­ly wit­nessed
and de­scribed, though in a some­what ex­cep­tional case. The little
fla­gel­late monad Her­pe­to­mo­nas is nor­mal­ly des­ti­tute of an un­du­la­ting
membrane, but possesses a single long terminal flagellum.
According to Dr D. L. Mackinnon, the cyto­plasm in a certain stage
of growth becomes somewhat “sticky,” a phrase which we may
in all probability interpret to mean that its surface tension is
being reduced. For this stickiness is
shewn in two ways. In the first place,
the long body, in the course of its
various bending movements, is apt to
adhere head to tail (so to speak), giving
a rounded or sometimes annular form
to the organism, such as has also been
described in certain species or stages
of Trypanosomes. But again, the
long flagellum, if it get bent backwards
upon the body, tends to adhere
to its surface. “Where the flagellum
was pretty long and active, its efforts
to continue movement under these
abnormal conditions resulted in the
gradual lifting up from the cytoplasm
of the body of a sort of <i>pseudo</i>-undulating
membrane (Fig. <a href="#fig92" title="go to Fig. 92">92</a>). The movements of this structure
were so exactly those of a true undulating
membrane that it was <span class="xxpn" id="p269">{269}</span>
difficult to believe one was not dealing with a small, blunt
trypanosome<a class="afnanch" href="#fn316" id="fnanch316">316</a>.”
This in short is a precise description of the
mode of development which, from theoretical con­si­de­ra­tions
alone, we should conceive to be the natural if not the only
possible way in which the undulating membrane could come into
existence.</p>

<p>There is a genus closely allied to Trypanosoma, viz. Trypanoplasma,
which possesses one free flagellum, together with an
undulating membrane; and it resembles the neighbouring genus
Bodo, save that the latter has two flagella and no undulating
membrane. In like manner, Trypanosoma so closely resembles
Herpetomonas that, when individuals ascribed to the former genus
exhibit a free flagellum only, they are said to be in the “Herpetomonas
stage.” In short all through the order, we have pairs
of genera, which are presumed to be separate and distinct, viz.
Trypanosoma-Herpetomonas, Trypanoplasma-Bodo, Trichomastix-Trichomonas,
in which one differs from the other mainly if not
solely in the fact that a free flagellum in the one is replaced by an
undulating membrane in the other. We can scarcely doubt that
the two structures are essentially one and the same.</p>

<p>The undulating membrane of a Trypanosome, then, according
to our interpretation of it, is a liquid film and must obey the law
of constant mean curvature. It is under curious limitations of
freedom: for by one border it is attached to the comparatively
motionless body, while its free border is constituted by a flagellum
which retains its activity and is being constantly thrown, like the
lash of a whip, into wavy curves. It follows that the membrane,
for every alteration of its longitudinal curvature, must at the same
instant become curved in a direction perpendicular thereto; it
bends, not as a tape bends, but with the accompaniment of beautiful
but tiny waves of double curvature, all tending towards the
establishment of an “equipotential surface”; and its char­ac­ter­is­tic
undulations are not originated by an active mobility of the
membrane but are due to the molecular tensions which produce
the very same result in a soap-film under similar circumstances.</p>

<p>In certain Spirochaetes, <i>S. anodontae</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig90" title="go to Fig. 90">90</a>)
and <i>S. balbiani</i> <span class="xxpn" id="p270">{270}</span>
(which we find in oysters), a very similar undulating membrane
exists, but it is coiled in a regular spiral round the body of the cell.
It forms a “screw-surface,” or helicoid, and, though we might
think that nothing could well be more curved, yet its math­e­mat­i­cal
properties are such that it constitutes a “ruled surface” whose
“mean curvature” is everywhere <i>nil</i>; and this property (as we
have seen) it shares with the plane, and with the plane alone.
Precisely such a surface, and of exquisite beauty, may be
produced by bending a wire upon itself so that part forms an
axial rod and part a spiral wrapping round the axis, and then
dipping the whole into a soapy solution.</p>

<p>These undulating and helicoid surfaces are exactly reproduced
among certain forms of spermatozoa. The tail of a spermatozoon
consists normally of an axis surrounded by clearer and more fluid
protoplasm, and the axis sometimes splits up into two or more
slender filaments. To surface tension operating between these
and the surface of the fluid protoplasm (just as in the case of the
flagellum of the Trypanosome), I ascribe the formation of the
undulating membrane which we find, for instance, in the spermatozoa
of the newt or salamander; and of the helicoid membrane,
wrapped in a far closer and more beautiful spiral than that which
we saw in Spirochaeta, which is char­ac­ter­is­tic of the spermatozoa
of many birds.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Before we pass from the subject of the conformation of the
solitary cell we must take some account of certain other exceptional
forms, less easy of explanation, and still less perfectly understood.
Such is the case, for instance, with the red blood-corpuscles of man
and other vertebrates; and among the sperm-cells of the decapod
crustacea we find forms still more aberrant and not less perplexing.
These are among the comparatively few cells or cell-like structures
whose form <i>seems</i> to be incapable of explanation by theories of
surface-tension.</p>

<p>In all the mammalia (save a very few) the red blood-corpuscles
are flattened circular discs, dimpled in upon their two opposite
sides. This configuration closely resembles that of an india-rubber
ball when we pinch it tightly between finger and thumb;
and we may also compare it with that
experiment of Plateau’s <span class="xxpn" id="p271">{271}</span>
(described on p. <a href="#p223" title="go to pg. 223">223</a>), where a flat cylindrical oil-drop, of certain
relative dimensions, can, by sucking away a little of the contained
oil, be made to assume the form of a biconcave disc, whose periphery
is part of a nodoidal surface. From the relation of the nodoid
to the “elastic curve,” we perceive that these two examples are
closely akin one to the other.</p>

<div class="dright dwth-e" id="fig93">
<img src="images/i271.png" width="390" height="165" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 93.</div></div>

<p>The form of the corpuscle is symmetrical, and its surface is
a surface of revolution; but it
is obviously not a surface of
constant mean curvature, nor of
constant pressure. For we see
at once that, in the sectional
diagram (Fig. <a href="#fig93" title="go to Fig. 93">93</a>), the pressure
inwards due to surface tension
is positive at <i>A</i>, and negative at <i>C</i>; at <i>B</i> there is no
curvature in the plane of the paper, while perpendicular to
it the curvature is negative, and the pressure therefore is also
negative. Accordingly, from the point of view of surface tension
alone, the blood-corpuscle is not a surface of equi­lib­rium; or in
other words, it is not a fluid drop suspended in another liquid.
It is obvious therefore that some other force or forces must be
at work, and the simple effect of mechanical pressure is here
excluded, because the blood-corpuscle exhibits its char­ac­ter­is­tic
shape while floating freely in the blood. In the lower vertebrates
the blood-corpuscles have the form of a flattened oval disc, with
rather sharp edges and ellipsoidal surfaces, and this again is
manifestly not a surface of equi­lib­rium.</p>

<p>Two facts are especially noteworthy in connection with the
form of the blood-corpuscle. In the first place, its form is only
maintained, that is to say it is only in equi­lib­rium, in relation to
certain properties of the medium in which it floats. If we add a
little water to the blood, the corpuscle quickly loses its char­ac­ter­is­tic
shape and becomes a spherical drop, that is to say a true
surface of minimal area and of stable equi­lib­rium. If on the other
hand we add a strong solution of salt, or a little glycerine, the
corpuscle contracts, and its surface becomes puckered and uneven.
In these phenomena it is so far obeying the laws of diffusion and
of surface tension. <span class="xxpn" id="p272">{272}</span></p>

<p>In the second place, it can be exactly imitated artificially by
means of other colloid substances. Many years ago Norris made the
very interesting observation that in an emulsion of glue the drops
assumed a biconcave form resembling that of the mammalian corpuscles<a class="afnanch" href="#fn317" id="fnanch317">317</a>.
The glue was impure, and doubtless contained lecithin;
and it is possible (as Professor Waymouth Reid tells me) to make
a similar emulsion with cerebrosides and cholesterin oleate, in
which the same conformation of the drops or particles is beautifully
shewn. Now such cholesterin bodies have an important place
among those in which Lehmann and others have shewn and studied
the formation of fluid crystals, that is to say of bodies in which
the forces of cry­stal­li­sa­tion and the forces of surface tension are
battling with one another<a class="afnanch" href="#fn318" id="fnanch318">318</a>;
and, for want of a better explanation,
we may in the meanwhile suggest that some such cause is at the
bottom of the conformation the explanation of which presents so
many difficulties. But we must not, perhaps, pass from this
subject without adding that the case is a difficult and complex
one from the physiological point of view. For the surface of a
blood-corpuscle consists of a “semi-permeable membrane,” through
which certain substances pass freely and not others (for the most
part anions and not cations), and it may be, accordingly, that we
have in life a continual state of osmotic inequi­lib­rium, of negative
osmotic tension within, to which comparatively simple cause the
imperfect distension of the corpuscle may be also due<a class="afnanch" href="#fn319" id="fnanch319">319</a>.
The whole
phenomenon would be comparatively easy to understand if we
might postulate a stiffer peripheral region to the corpuscle, in the
form for instance of a peripheral elastic ring. Such an annular
thickening or stiffening, like the “collapse-rings” which an engineer
inserts in a boiler, has been actually asserted to exist, but its
presence is not authenticated.</p>

<p>But it is not at all improbable that we have still much to
learn about the phenomena of osmosis itself, as manifested in the
case of minute bodies such as a blood-corpuscle; and (as Professor
Peddie suggests to me) it is by no means
impossible that <i>curvature</i> <span class="xxpn" id="p273">{273}</span>
of the surface may itself modify the osmotic or perhaps the adsorptive
action. If it should be found that osmotic action tended to
stop, or to reverse, on change of curvature, it would follow that
this phenomenon would give rise to internal currents; and the
change of pressure consequent on these would tend to intensify
the change of curvature when once started<a class="afnanch" href="#fn320" id="fnanch320">320</a>.</p>

<p>The sperm-cells of the Decapod crustacea exhibit various
singular shapes. In the Crayfish they are flattened cells with
stiff curved processes radiating outwards like a St Catherine’s
wheel; in Inachus there are two such circles of stiff processes;
in Galathea we have a still more complex form, with long and
slightly twisted processes. In all these cases, just as in the case
of the blood-corpuscle, the structure alters, and finally loses, its
char­ac­ter­is­tic form when the nature or constitution (or as we may
assume in particular—the density) of the surrounding medium is
changed.</p>

<p>Here again, as in the blood-corpuscle, we have to do with a
very important force, which we had not hitherto considered in this
connection,—the force of osmosis, manifested under conditions
similar to those of Pfeffer’s classical experiments on the plant-cell.
The surface of the cell acts as a
“semi-permeable membrane,” <span class="xxpn" id="p274">{274}</span>
permitting the passage of certain dissolved substances (or their
“ions”) and including or excluding others; and thus rendering
manifest and measurable the existence of a definite “osmotic
pressure.” In the case of the sperm-cells of Inachus, certain
quantitative experiments have been performed<a class="afnanch" href="#fn321" id="fnanch321">321</a>.
The sperm-cell
exhibits its char­ac­ter­is­tic conformation while lying in the serous
fluid of the animal’s body, in ordinary sea-water, or in a 5 per
cent. solution of potassium nitrate; these three fluids being all
“isotonic” with one another. As we alter the concentration of
potassium nitrate, the cell assumes certain definite forms cor­re­spon­ding
to definite concentrations of the salt; and, as a further
and final proof that the phenomenon is entirely physical, it is
found that other salts produce an identical effect when their
concentration is proportionate to their molecular weight, and
whatever identical effect is produced by various salts in their
respective concentrations, a similarly identical effect is produced
when these concentrations are doubled or otherwise proportionately
changed<a class="afnanch" href="#fn322" id="fnanch322">322</a>.</p>

<p>If we look then, upon the spherical form of the cell
as its true condition of symmetry and of equi­lib­rium, we
see that what we call its normal appearance is just one of
many intermediate phases of shrinkage, brought about by
the abstraction of fluid from its interior as the result
of an osmotic pressure greater outside than inside the
cell, and where the shrinkage of <i>volume</i> is not kept
pace with by a contraction of the <i>surface-area</i>. In the
case of the blood-corpuscle, the shrinkage is of no great
amount, and the resulting deformation is symmetrical; such
structural inequality as may be necessary to account for
it need be but small. But in the case of the sperm-cells,
we must have, and we actually do find, a somewhat
complicated arrangement of more or less rigid or elastic
structures in the wall of the cell, which like the wire
framework in Plateau’s experiments, restrain and modify
the forces acting on the drop. In one form of Plateau’s
experiments, instead of</p>

<p class="pcontinue">supporting his drop on
rings or frames of wire, he laid upon its surface one or
more elastic coils; and then, on withdrawing oil from
the centre of his globule, he saw its uniform shrinkage
counteracted by the spiral springs, with the result that
the centre of each elastic coil seemed to shoot out into
a prominence. Just such spiral coils are figured (after
Koltzoff) in Fig. <a href="#fig96" title="go to Fig. 96">96</a>; and they may be regarded as precisely
akin to those local thickenings, spiral and other, to
which we have already ascribed the cylindrical form of
the Spirogyra cell. In all probability we must in like
manner attribute the peculiar spiral and other forms, for
instance of many Infusoria, to the <span class="xxpn"
id="p276">{276}</span> presence, among the multitudinous
other differentiations of their protoplasmic substance,
of such more or less elastic fibrillae, which play as it
were the part of a microscopic skeleton<a class="afnanch"
href="#fn323" id="fnanch323">323</a>.
<br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>But these cases which we have just dealt with, lead us to
another consideration. In a semi-permeable membrane, through
which water passes freely in and out, the conditions of a liquid
surface are greatly modified; and, in the ideal or ultimate case,
there is neither surface nor surface tension at all. And this would
lead us somewhat to reconsider our position, and to enquire
whether the true surface tension of a liquid film is actually
responsible for <i>all</i> that we have ascribed to it, or whether certain
of the phenomena which we have assigned to that cause may not
in part be due to the contractility of definite and elastic membranes.
But to in­ves­ti­gate this question, in particular cases, is rather for
the physiologist: and the morphologist may go on his way,
paying little heed to what is no doubt a difficulty. In surface
tension we have the production of a film with the properties of an
elastic membrane, and with the special peculiarity that contraction
continues with the same energy however far the process may have
already gone; while the ordinary elastic membrane contracts to
a certain extent, and contracts no more. But within wide limits
the essential phenomena are the same in both cases. Our
fundamental equations apply to both cases alike. And accordingly,
so long as our purpose is <i>morphological</i>, so long as what we
seek to explain is regularity and definiteness of form, it matters
little if we should happen, here or there, to confuse surface tension
with elasticity, the contractile forces manifested at a liquid
surface with those which come into play at the complex internal
surfaces of an elastic solid.</p>

necessary for us to take account of the phenomenon, though it
be in the most elementary way.</p>

<p>In the brief account of the theory of surface tension with which
our last chapter began, it was pointed out that, in a drop of liquid,
the potential energy of the system could be diminished, and work
manifested accordingly, in two ways. In the first place we saw
that, at our liquid surface, surface tension tends to set up an
equi­lib­rium of form, in which the surface is reduced or contracted
either to the absolute minimum of a sphere, or at any rate to the
least possible area which is permitted by the various circumstances
and conditions; and if the two bodies which comprise our system,
namely the drop of liquid and its surrounding medium, be simple
substances, and the system be uncomplicated by other distributions
of force, then the energy of the system will have done its work
when this equi­lib­rium of form, this minimal area of surface, is
once attained. This phenomenon of the production of a minimal
surface-area we have now seen to be of fundamental importance
in the external morphology of the cell, and especially (so far
as we have yet gone) of the solitary cell
or unicellular organism. <span class="xxpn" id="p278">{278}</span></p>

<p>But we also saw, according to Gauss’s equation, that the
potential energy of the system will be diminished (and its diminution
will accordingly be manifested in work) if from any cause
the specific surface energy be diminished, that is to say if it be
brought more nearly to an equality with the specific energy of the
molecules in the interior of the liquid mass. This latter is a
phenomenon of great moment in modern physiology, and, while
we need not attempt to deal with it in detail, it has a bearing on
cell-form and cell-structure which we cannot afford to overlook.</p>

<p>In various ways a diminution of the surface energy may be
brought about. For instance, it is known that every isolated drop
of fluid has, under normal circumstances, a surface-charge of
electricity: in such a way that a positive or negative charge (as
the case may be) is inherent in the surface of the drop, while a
cor­re­spon­ding charge, of contrary sign, is inherent in the
immediately adjacent molecular layer of the surrounding medium.
Now the effect of this distribution, by which all the surface
molecules of our drop are similarly charged, is that by virtue of
this charge they tend to repel one another, and possibly also to
draw other molecules, of opposite charge, from the interior of the
mass; the result being in either case to antagonise or cancel,
more or less, that normal tendency of the surface molecules to
attract one another which is manifested in surface tension. In
other words, an increased electrical charge concentrating at the
surface of a drop tends, whether it be positive or negative, to
<i>lower</i> the surface tension.</p>

<p>But a still more important case has next to be considered.
Let us suppose that our drop consists no longer of a single chemical
substance, but contains other substances either in suspension or
in solution. Suppose (as a very simple case) that it be a watery
fluid, exposed to air, and containing droplets of oil: we know that
the specific surface tension of oil in contact with air is much less
than that of water, and it follows that, if the watery surface of
our drop be replaced by an oily surface the specific surface energy
of the system will be notably diminished. Now under these
circumstances it is found that (quite apart from gravity, by which
the oil might <i>float</i> to the surface) the oil has a tendency to be
<i>drawn</i> to the surface; and this phenomenon
of molecular attraction <span class="xxpn" id="p279">{279}</span>
or “adsorption” represents the work done, equivalent to the
diminished potential energy of the system<a class="afnanch" href="#fn325" id="fnanch325">325</a>.
In more general
terms, if a liquid (or one or other of two adjacent liquids) be a
chemical mixture, some one constituent in which, if it entered
into or increased in amount in the surface layer, would have the
effect of diminishing its surface tension, then that constituent will
have a tendency to accumulate or concentrate at the surface: the
surface tension may be said, as it were, to exercise an attraction
on this constituent substance, drawing it into the surface layer,
and this tendency will proceed until at a certain “surface concentration”
equi­lib­rium is reached, its opponent being that osmotic
force which tends to keep the substance in uniform solution or
diffusion.</p>

<p>In the complex mixtures which constitute the protoplasm of
the living cell, this phenomenon of “adsorption” has abundant
play: for many of these constituents, such as oils, soaps, albumens,
etc. possess the required property of diminishing surface tension.</p>

<p>Moreover, the more a substance has the power of lowering the
surface tension of the liquid in which it happens to be dissolved,
the more will it tend to displace another and less effective substance
from the surface layer. Thus we know that protoplasm always
contains fats or oils, not only in visible drops, but also in the
finest suspension or “colloidal solution.” If under any impulse,
such for instance as might arise from the Brownian movement,
a droplet of oil be brought close to the surface, it is at once drawn
into that surface, and tends to spread itself in a thin layer over
the whole surface of the cell. But a soapy surface (for instance)
would have in contact with the surrounding water a surface tension
even less than that of the film of oil: and consequently, if soap
be present in the water it will in turn be adsorbed, and will tend
to displace the oil from the surface pellicle<a class="afnanch" href="#fn326" id="fnanch326">326</a>.
And this is all as <span class="xxpn" id="p280">{280}</span>
much as to say that the molecules of the dissolved or suspended
substance or substances will so distribute themselves throughout
the drop as to lead towards an equi­lib­rium, for each small unit
of volume, between the superficial and internal energy; or so, in
other words, as to lead towards a reduction to a minimum of the
potential energy of the system. This tendency to concentration
at the surface of any substance within the cell by which the surface
tension tends to be diminished, or <i>vice versa</i>, constitutes, then,
the phenomenon of <i>Adsorption</i>; and the general statement by
which it is defined is known as the Willard-Gibbs, or Gibbs-Thomson
law<a class="afnanch" href="#fn327" id="fnanch327">327</a>.</p>

<p>Among the many important physical features or concomitants
of this phenomenon, let us take note at present that we need
not conceive of a strictly superficial distribution of the adsorbed
substance, that is to say of its direct association with the surface
layer of molecules such as we imagined in the case of the electrical
charge; but rather of a progressive tendency to concentrate,
more and more, as the surface is nearly approached. Indeed we
may conceive the colloid or gelatinous precipitate in which, in the
case of our protoplasmic cell, the dissolved substance tends often
to be thrown down, to constitute one boundary layer after another,
the general effect being intensified and multiplied by the repeated
addition of these new surfaces.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is not less important to observe that the process
of adsorption, in the neighbourhood of the surface of a heterogeneous
liquid mass, is a process which <i>takes time</i>; the tendency
to surface concentration is a gradual and progressive one, and will
fluctuate with every minute change in the composition of our
substance and with every change in the area of its surface. In
other words, it involves (in every heterogeneous substance) a
continual instability of equi­lib­rium: and
a constant manifestation <span class="xxpn" id="p281">{281}</span>
of motion, sometimes in the mere invisible transfer of molecules
but often in the production of visible currents of fluid or manifest
alterations in the form or outline of the system.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The physiologist, as we have already remarked, takes account
of the general phenomenon of adsorption in many ways: particularly
in connection with various results and consequences of
osmosis, inasmuch as this process is dependent on the presence
of a membrane, or membranes, such as the phenomenon of adsorption
brings into existence. For instance it plays a leading part
in all modern theories of muscular contraction, in which phenomenon
a connection with surface tension was first indicated by
FitzGerald and d’Arsonval nearly forty years ago<a class="afnanch" href="#fn328" id="fnanch328">328</a>.
And, as
W. Ostwald was the first to shew, it gives us an entirely new
conception of the relation of gases (that is to say, of oxygen and
carbon dioxide) to the red corpuscles of the blood<a class="afnanch" href="#fn329" id="fnanch329">329</a>.</p>

<p>But restricting ourselves, as much as may be, to our morphological
aspect of the case, there are several ways in which adsorption
begins at once to throw light upon our subject.</p>

<p>In the first place, our preliminary account, such as it is, is
already tantamount to a description of the process of development
of a cell-membrane, or cell-wall. The so-called “secretion”
of this cell-wall is nothing more than a sort of exudation, or
striving towards the surface, of certain constituent molecules or
particles within the cell; and the Gibbs-Thomson law formulates,
in part at least, the conditions under which they do so. The
adsorbed material may range from the almost unrecognisable
pellicle of a blood-corpuscle to the distinctly differentiated
“ectosarc” of a protozoan, and again to the development of a
fully formed cell-wall, as in the cellulose partitions of a vegetable
tissue. In such cases, the dissolved and adsorbable material has
not only the property of lowering the surface
tension, and hence <span class="xxpn" id="p282">{282}</span>
of itself accumulating at the surface, but has also the property
of increasing the viscosity and mechanical rigidity of the material
in which it is dissolved or suspended, and so of constituting
a visible and tangible “membrane<a class="afnanch" href="#fn330" id="fnanch330">330</a>.”
The “zoogloea” around a
group of bacteria is probably a phenomenon of the same order.
In the superficial deposition of inorganic materials we see the
same process abundantly exemplified. Not only do we have the
simple case of the building of a shell or “test” upon the outward
surface of a living cell, as for instance in a Foraminifer, but in a
subsequent chapter, when we come to deal with various spicules
and spicular skeletons such as those of the sponges and of the
Radiolaria, we shall see that it is highly char­ac­ter­is­tic of the
whole process of spicule-formation for the deposits to be laid
down just in the “interfacial” boundaries between cells or
vacuoles, and that the form of the spicular structures tends in
many cases to be regulated and determined by the arrangement
of these boundaries.</p>

<div class="psmprnt3">
<p>In physical chemistry, an important distinction is drawn
between adsorption and <i>pseudo-adsorption</i><a class="afnanch"
href="#fn331" id="fnanch331">331</a>, the former being
a <i>reversible</i>, the latter an irreversible or permanent
phenomenon. That is to say, adsorption, strictly speaking,
implies the surface-concentration of a dissolved substance,
under circumstances which, if they be altered or reversed,
will cause the concentration to diminish or disappear. But
pseudo-adsorption includes cases, doubtless originating
in adsorption proper, where subsequent changes leave the
concentrated substance incapable of re-entering the liquid
system. It is obvious that many (though not all) of our
biological illustrations, for instance the formation of
spicules or of permanent cell-membranes, belong to the class
of so-called pseudo-adsorption phenomena. But the apparent
contrast between the two is in the main a secondary one, and
however important to the chemist is of little consequence to
us. <span class="xxpn" id="p283">{283}</span></p>
</div><!--psmprnt3-->

<p>While this brief sketch of the theory of membrane-formation
is cursory and inadequate, it is enough to shew that the physical
theory of adsorption tends in part to overturn, in part to simplify
enormously, the older histological descriptions. We can no longer
be content with such statements as that of Strasbürger, that
membrane-formation in general is associated with the “activity
of the kinoplasm,” or that of Harper that a certain spore-membrane
arises directly from the astral rays<a class="afnanch" href="#fn332" id="fnanch332">332</a>.
In short, we have easily
reached the general conclusion that, the formation of a cell-wall
or cell-membrane is a chemico-physical phenomenon, which the
purely objective methods of the biological microscopist do not
suffice to interpret.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>If the process of adsorption, on which the formation of a
membrane depends, be itself dependent on the power of the
adsorbed substance to lower the surface tension, it is obvious that
adsorption can only take place when the surface tension already
present is greater than zero. It is for this reason that films or
threads of creeping protoplasm shew little tendency, or none, to
cover themselves with an encysting membrane; and that it is
only when, in an altered phase, the protoplasm has developed
a positive surface tension, and has accordingly gathered itself up
into a more or less spherical body, that the tendency to form a
membrane is manifested, and the organism develops its “cyst”
or cell-wall.</p>

<p>It is found that a rise of temperature greatly reduces the
adsorbability of a substance, and this doubtless comes, either in
part or whole, from the fact that a rise of temperature is itself
a cause of the lowering of surface tension. We may in all probability
ascribe to this fact and to its converse, or at least associate
with it, such phenomena as the encystment of unicellular organisms
at the approach of winter, or the frequent formation of strong
shells or membranous capsules in “winter-eggs.”</p>

<p>Again, since a film or a froth (which is a system of films) can
only be maintained by virtue of a certain
viscosity or rigidity of <span class="xxpn" id="p284">{284}</span>
the liquid, it may be quickly caused to disappear by the presence
in its neighbourhood of some substance capable of reducing the
surface tension; for this substance, being adsorbed, may displace
from the adsorptive layer a material to which was due the rigidity
of the film. In this way a “bathytonic” substance such as ether
causes most foams to subside, and the pouring oil on troubled
waters not only stills the waves but still more quickly dissipates
the foam of the breakers. The process of breaking up an alveolar
network, such as occurs at a certain stage in the nuclear division
of the cell, may perhaps be ascribed in part to such a cause, as
well as to the direct lowering of surface tension by electrical
agency.</p>

<p>Our last illustration has led us back to the subject of a previous
chapter, namely to the visible configuration of the interior of the
cell; and in connection with this wide subject there are many
phenomena on which light is apparently thrown by our knowledge
of adsorption, and of which we took little or no account in our
former discussion. One of these phenomena is that visible or
concrete “polarity,” which we have already seen to be in some way
associated with a dynamical polarity of the cell.</p>

<p>This morphological polarity may be of a very simple kind, as
when, in an epithelial cell, it is manifested by the outward shape
of the elongated or columnar cell itself, by the essential difference
between its free surface and its attached base, or by the presence
in the neighbourhood of the former of mucous or other products
of the cell’s activity. But in a great many cases, this “polarised”
symmetry is supplemented by the presence of various fibrillae, or
of linear arrangements of particles, which in the elongated or
“monopolar” cell run parallel with its axis, and which tend to
a radial arrangement in the more or less rounded or spherical
cell. Of late years especially, an immense importance has been
attached to these various linear or fibrillar arrangements, as they
occur (<i>after staining</i>) in the cell-substance of intestinal epithelium,
of spermatocytes, of ganglion cells, and most abundantly and
most frequently of all in gland cells. Various functions, which
seem somewhat arbitrarily chosen, have been assigned, and many
hard names given to them; for these structures now include your
mitochondria and your chondriokonts (both of
these being varieties <span class="xxpn" id="p285">{285}</span>
of chondriosomes), your Altmann’s granules, your microsomes,
pseudo-chromosomes, epidermal fibrils and basal filaments, your
archeoplasm and ergastoplasm, and probably your idiozomes,
plasmosomes, and many other histological minutiae<a class="afnanch" href="#fn333" id="fnanch333">333</a>.</p>

 (after Barratt); <i>C</i>, do. in pancreas of frog (after
 Mathews).</div></div>

<p>The position of these bodies with regard to the other cell-structures
is carefully described. Sometimes they lie in the
neighbourhood of the nucleus itself, that is to say in proximity to
the fluid boundary surface which separates the nucleus from the
cytoplasm; and in this position they often form a somewhat cloudy
sphere which constitutes the <i>Nebenkern</i>. In the majority of cases,
as in the epithelial cells, they form filamentous structures, and rows
of granules, whose main direction is parallel to the axis of the
cell, and which may, in some cases, and in some forms, be conspicuous
at the one end, and in some cases at the other end of
the cell. But I do not find that the histologists attempt to explain,
or to correlate with other phenomena, the tendency of these bodies
to lie parallel with the axis, and perpendicular to the extremities
of the cell; it is merely noted as a peculiarity, or a specific character,
of these particular structures. Extraordinarily complicated and
diverse functions have been ascribed to them. Engelmann’s
“Fibrillenkonus,” which was almost certainly another aspect of
the same phenomenon, was held by him and by cytologists like
Breda and Heidenhain, to be an apparatus
connected in some <span class="xxpn" id="p286">{286}</span>
unexplained way with the mechanism of ciliary movement.
Meves looked upon the chondriosomes as the actual carriers or
transmitters of heredity<a class="afnanch" href="#fn334" id="fnanch334">334</a>.
Altmann invented a new aphorism,
<i>Omne granulum e granulo</i>, as a refinement of Virchow’s <i>omnis
cellula e cellula</i>; and many other histologists, more or less in accord,
accepted the chondriosomes as important entities, <i>sui generis</i>,
intermediate in grade between the cell itself and its ultimate
molecular components. The extreme cytologists of the Munich
school, Popoff, Goldschmidt and others, following Richard Hertwig,
declaring these structures to be identical with “chromidia” (under
which name Hertwig ranked all extra-nuclear chromatin), would
assign them complex functions in maintaining the balance between
nuclear and cytoplasmic material; and the “chromidial hypothesis,”
as every reader of recent cytological literature knows, has
become a very abstruse and complicated thing<a class="afnanch" href="#fn335" id="fnanch335">335</a>.
With the help
of the “binuclearity hypothesis” of Schaudinn and his school, it
has given us the chromidial net, the chromidial apparatus, the
trophochromidia, idiochromidia, gametochromidia, the protogonoplasm,
and many other novel and original conceptions. The
names are apt to vary somewhat in significance from one writer
to another.</p>

<p>The outstanding fact, as it seems to me, is that physiological
science has been heavily burdened in this matter, with a jargon
of names and a thick cloud of hypotheses; while, from the physical
point of view we are tempted to see but little mystery in the
whole phenomenon, and to ascribe it, in all probability and in
general terms, to the gathering or “clumping” together, under
surface tension, of various constituents of the heterogeneous cell-content,
and to the drawing out of these little clumps along the
axis of the cell towards one or other of its extremities, in relation
to osmotic currents, as these in turn are set up
in direct relation <span class="xxpn" id="p287">{287}</span>
to the phenomena of surface energy and of adsorption<a class="afnanch" href="#fn336" id="fnanch336">336</a>.
And
all this implies that the study of these minute structures, if it
teach us nothing else, at least surely and certainly reveals to us
the presence of a definite “field of force,” and a dynamical polarity
within the cell.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Our next and last illustration of the effects of adsorption,
which we owe to the investigations of Professor Macallum, is of
great importance; for it introduces us to a series of phenomena
in regard to which we seem now to stand on firmer ground than
in some of the foregoing cases, though we cannot yet consider that
the whole story has been told. In our last chapter we were
restricted mainly, though not entirely, to a consideration of figures
of equi­lib­rium, such as the sphere, the cylinder or the unduloid;
and we began at once to find ourselves in difficulties when we were
confronted by departures from symmetry, as for instance in the
simple case of the ellipsoidal yeast-cell and the production of its
bud. We found the cylindrical cell of Spirogyra, with its plane
or spherical ends, a comparatively simple matter to understand;
but when this uniform cylinder puts out a lateral outgrowth, in
the act of conjugation, we have a new and very different system
of forces to explain. The analogy of the soap-bubble, or of the
simple liquid drop, was apt to lead us to suppose that the surface
tension was, on the whole, uniform over the surface of our cell;
and that its departures from symmetry of form were therefore
likely to be due to variations in external resistance. But if we
have been inclined to make such an
assumption we must now <span class="xxpn" id="p288">{288}</span>
reconsider it, and be prepared to deal with important localised
variations in the surface tension of the cell. For, as a matter of
fact, the simple case of a perfectly symmetrical drop, with uniform
surface, at which adsorption takes place with similar uniformity,
is probably rare in physics, and rarer still (if it exist at all) in the
fluid or fluid-containing system which we call in biology a cell.
We have mostly to do with cells whose general heterogeneity of
substance leads to qualitative differences of surface, and hence to
varying distributions of surface tension. We must accordingly
in­ves­ti­gate the case of a cell which displays some definite and
regular heterogeneity of its liquid surface, just as Amoeba displays
a heterogeneity which is complex, irregular and continually
fluctuating in amount and distribution. Such heterogeneity as
we are speaking of must be essentially chemical, and the preliminary
problem is to devise methods of “microchemical” analysis,
which shall reveal <i>localised</i> accumulations of particular substances
within the narrow limits of a cell, in the hope that, their normal
effect on surface tension being ascertained, we may then correlate
with their presence and distribution the actual indications of
varying surface tension which the form or movement of the cell
displays. In theory the method is all that we could wish, but in
practice we must be content with a very limited application of it;
for the substances which may have such action as we are looking
for, and which are also actual or possible constituents of the cell,
are very numerous, while the means are very seldom at hand to
demonstrate their precise distribution and localisation. But in
one or two cases we have such means, and the most notable is in
connection with the element potassium. As Professor Macallum
has shewn, this element can be revealed, in very minute quantities,
by means of a certain salt, a nitrite of cobalt and sodium<a class="afnanch" href="#fn337" id="fnanch337">337</a>.
This
salt penetrates readily into the tissues and into the interior of the
cell; it combines with potassium to form a sparingly soluble
nitrite of cobalt, sodium and potassium; and this, on subsequent
treatment with ammonium sulphide, is converted into a char­ac­ter­is­tic
black precipitate of cobaltic sulphide<a class="afnanch" href="#fn338" id="fnanch338">338</a>.
<span class="xxpn" id="p289">{289}</span></p>

<p>By this means Macallum demonstrated some years ago the
unexpected presence of accumulations of potassium (i.e. of chloride
or other salts of potassium) localised in particular parts of various
cells, both solitary cells and tissue cells; and he arrived at the
conclusion that the localised accumulations in question were
simply evidences of <i>concentration</i> of the dissolved potassium salts,
formed and localised in accordance with the Gibbs-Thomson law.
In other words, these accumulations, occurring as they actually do
in connection with various boundary surfaces, are evidence, when
they appear irregularly distributed over such a surface, of inequalities
in its surface tension<a class="afnanch" href="#fn339" id="fnanch339">339</a>;
and we may safely take it that
our potassium salts, like inorganic substances in general, tend to
<i>raise</i> the surface tension, and will therefore be found concentrating
at a portion of the surface whose tension is weak<a class="afnanch" href="#fn340" id="fnanch340">340</a>.</p>

<p>In Professor Macallum’s figure (Fig. <a href="#fig98" title="go to Fig. 98">98</a>, 1) of the little green
alga Pleurocarpus, we see that one side of the cell is beginning to
bulge out in a wide convexity. This bulge is, in the first place,
a sign of weakened surface tension on one side of the cell, which as
a whole had hitherto been a symmetrical cylinder; in the second
place, we see that the bulging area corresponds to the position of
a great concentration of the potassic salt; while in the third place,
from the physiological point of view, we call the phenomenon
the first stage in the process of conjugation. In Fig. <a href="#fig98" title="go to Fig. 98">98</a>, 2, of
Mesocarpus (a close ally of Spirogyra), we see the same phenomenon
admirably exemplified in a later stage. From the adjacent cells
distinct outgrowths are being emitted, where the surface tension has
been weakened: just as the glass-blower warms and softens a small
part of his tube to blow out the softened area into a bubble or
diverticulum; and in our Mesocarpus cells (besides a certain
amount of potassium rendered visible over
the boundary which <span class="xxpn" id="p290">{290}</span>
separates the green protoplasm from the cell-sap), there is a very
large accumulation precisely at the point where the tension of the
originally cylindrical cell is weakening to produce the bulge.
But in a still later stage, when the boundary between the two
conjugating cells is lost and the cytoplasm of the two cells becomes
fused together, then the signs of potassic concentration quickly
disappear, the salt becoming generally diffused through the now
symmetrical and spherical “zygospore.”</p>

 (3) sprouting spores of <i>Equisetum</i>. (After
 Macallum.)</div></div>

<p>In a spore of Equisetum (Fig. <a href="#fig98" title="go to Fig. 98">98</a>, 3), while it is still a single cell,
no localised concentration of potassium is to be discerned; but as
soon as the spore has divided, by an internal partition, into two
cells, the potassium salt is found to be concentrated in the smaller
one, and especially towards its outer wall, which is marked by a
pronounced convexity. And as this convexity (which corresponds
to one pole of the now asymmetrical, or quasi-ellipsoidal spore)
grows out into the root-hair, the potassium salt accompanies its
growth, and is concentrated under its wall.
The concentration is, <span class="xxpn" id="p291">{291}</span>
accordingly, a concomitant of the diminished surface tension which
is manifested in the altered configuration of the system.</p>

<p>In the case of ciliate or flagellate cells, there is to be found a
char­ac­ter­is­tic accumulation of potassium at and near the base of
the cilia. The relation of ciliary movement to surface tension
lies beyond our range, but the fact which we have just mentioned
throws light upon the frequent or general presence of a little
protuberance of the cell-surface just where a flagellum is given
off (cf. p. <a href="#p247" title="go to pg. 247">247</a>), and of a little projecting ridge or fillet at the base
of an isolated row of cilia, such as we find in Vorticella.</p>

<p>Yet another of Professor Macallum’s demonstrations, though
its interest is mainly physiological, will help us somewhat further
to comprehend what is implied in our phenomenon. In a normal
cell of Spirogyra, a concentration of potassium is revealed along
the whole surface of the spiral coil of chlorophyll-bearing, or
“chromatophoral,” protoplasm, the rest of the cell being wholly
destitute of the former substance: the indication being that, at
this particular boundary, between chromatophore and cell-sap,
the surface tension is small in comparison with any other interfacial
surface within the system.</p>

<p>Now as Macallum points out, the presence of potassium is
known to be a factor, in connection with the chlorophyll-bearing
protoplasm, in the synthetic production of starch from CO&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub> under
the influence of sunlight. But we are left in some doubt as to
the consecutive order of the phenomena. For the lowered surface
tension, indicated by the presence of the potassium, may be
itself a cause of the carbohydrate synthesis; while on the other
hand, this synthesis may be attended by the production of substances
(e.g. formaldehyde) which lower the surface tension, and
so conduce to the concentration of potassium. All we know for
certain is that the several phenomena are associated with one
another, as apparently inseparable parts or inevitable concomitants
of a certain complex action.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>And now to return, for a moment, to the question of cell-form.
When we assert that the form of a cell (in the absence of mechanical
pressure) is essentially dependent on surface tension, and even when
we make the preliminary assumption that
protoplasm is essentially <span class="xxpn" id="p292">{292}</span>
a fluid, we are resting our belief on a general consensus of evidence,
rather than on compliance with any one crucial definition. The
simple fact is that the agreement of cell-forms with the forms
which physical experiment and math­e­mat­i­cal theory assign to
liquids under the influence of surface tension, is so frequently and
often so typically manifested, that we are led, or driven, to accept
the surface tension hypothesis as generally applicable and as
equivalent to a universal law. The occasional difficulties or
apparent exceptions are such as call for further enquiry, but fall
short of throwing doubt upon our hypothesis. Macallum’s
researches introduce a new element of certainty, a “nail in a sure
place,” when they demonstrate that, in certain movements or
changes of form which we should naturally attribute to weakened
surface tension, a chemical concentration which would naturally
accompany such weakening actually takes place. They further
teach us that in the cell a chemical heterogeneity may exist of
a very marked kind, certain substances being accumulated here
and absent there, within the narrow bounds of the system.</p>

<p>Such localised accumulations can as yet only be demonstrated
in the case of a very few substances, and of a single one in particular;
and these are substances whose presence does not produce,
but whose concentration tends to follow, a weakening of surface
tension. The physical cause of the localised inequalities of surface
tension remains unknown. We may assume, if we please, that it
is due to the prior accumulation, or local production, of chemical
bodies which would have this direct effect; though we are by
no means limited to this hypothesis.</p>

<p>But in spite of some remaining difficulties and uncertainties,
we have arrived at the conclusion, as regards unicellular organisms,
that not only their general configuration but also <i>their departures
from symmetry</i> may be correlated with the molecular forces
manifested in their fluid
or semi-fluid surfaces.</p>

Forms of Tissues Or Cell-aggregates.">CHAPTER VII
<span class="h2ttl">
THE FORMS OF TISSUES OR CELL-AGGREGATES</span></h2></div>

<p>We now pass from the consideration of the solitary cell to that
of cells in contact with one another,—to what we may call in
the first instance “cell-aggregates,”—through which we shall be led
ultimately to the study of complex tissues. In this part of our
subject, as in the preceding chapters, we shall have to give some
consideration to the effects of various forces; but, as in the case
of the conformation of the solitary cell, we shall probably find,
and we may at least begin by assuming, that the agency of surface
tension is especially manifest and important. The effect of this
surface tension will chiefly manifest itself in the production of
surfaces <i>minimae areae</i>: where, as Plateau was always careful to
point out, we must understand by this expression not an absolute,
but a relative minimum, an area, that is to say, which approximates
to an absolute minimum as nearly as circumstances and the
conditions of the case permit.</p>

<p>There are certain fundamental principles, or fundamental
equations, besides those which we have already considered, which
we shall need in our enquiry. For instance the case which we
briefly touched upon (on p. <a href="#p265" title="go to pg. 265">265</a>) of the angle of contact between
the protoplasm and the axial filament in a Heliozoan we shall
now find to be but a particular case of a general and elementary
theorem.</p>

<p>Let us re-state as follows, in terms of <i>Energy</i>, the general
principle which underlies the theory of surface tension or capillarity.</p>

<p>When a fluid is in contact with another fluid, or with a solid
or a gas, a portion of the energy of the system (that, namely,
which we call surface energy), is proportional to the area of the
surface of contact: it is also proportional to a coefficient which
is specific for each particular pair of substances, and which is
constant for these, save only in so far as it may
be modified by <span class="xxpn" id="p294">{294}</span>
changes of temperature or of electric charge. The condition of
<i>minimum potential energy</i> in the system, which is the condition of
equi­lib­rium, will accordingly be obtained by the utmost possible
diminution in the area of the surfaces in contact. When we have
<i>three</i> bodies in contact, the case becomes a little more complex.
Suppose for instance we have a drop of some fluid, <i>A</i>, floating on
another fluid, <i>B</i>, and exposed to air, <i>C</i>. The whole surface energy
of the system may now be considered as divided into two parts,
one at the surface of the drop, and the other outside of the same;
the latter portion is inherent in the surface <i>BC</i>, between the mass
of fluid <i>B</i> and the superincumbent air, <i>C</i>; but the former portion
consists of two parts, for it is divided between the two surfaces <i>AB</i>
and <i>AC</i>, that namely which separates the drop from the surrounding
fluid and that which separates it from the atmosphere. So far as</p>

<div class="dctr05" id="fig99">
<img src="images/i294.png" width="434" height="89" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 99.</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">the drop is concerned, then, equi­lib­rium depends on a proper
balance between the energy, per unit area, which is resident in
its own two surfaces, and that which is external thereto: that is
to say, if we call <i>E&#xfeff;<sub>bc</sub></i> the energy at the surface between the two
fluids, and so on with the other two pairs of surface energies, the
condition of equi­lib­rium, or of maintenance of the drop, is that</p>

<div class="dmaths">
<div><i>E&#xfeff;<sub>bc</sub></i>&#x202f;&#x3c;&#x202f;<i>E&#xfeff;<sub>ab</sub></i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;<i>E&#xfeff;<sub>ac</sub></i>.
</div>

<p class="pcontinue">If, on the other hand, the fluid
<i>A</i> happens to be oil and the fluid <i>B</i>, water, then the
energy <i>per unit area</i> of the water-air surface is greater
than that of the oil-air surface and that of the oil-water
surface together; i.e.</p>

<div><i>E&#xfeff;<sub>wa</sub></i>&#x202f;&#x3e;&#x202f;<i>E&#xfeff;<sub>oa</sub></i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;<i>E&#xfeff;<sub>ow</sub></i>.
</div>

<p class="pcontinue">Here there is no equi­lib­rium, and in order to obtain it the water-air
surface must always tend to decrease and the other two interfacial
surfaces to increase; which is as much as to say that the water
tends to become covered by a spreading film of oil, and the water-air
surface to be abolished. <span class="xxpn" id="p295">{295}</span></p>
</div><!--dmaths-->

<p>The surface energy of which we have here spoken is manifested
in that contractile force, or “tension,” of which we have already
had so much to say<a class="afnanch" href="#fn341" id="fnanch341">341</a>.
In any part of the free water surface, for
instance, one surface particle attracts another surface particle, and
the resultant of these multitudinous attractions is an equi­lib­rium
of tension throughout this particular surface. In the case of our
three bodies in contact with one another, and within a small area
very near to the point of contact, a water particle (for instance)
will be pulled outwards by another water particle; but on the
opposite side, so to speak, there will be no water surface, and no
water particle, to furnish the counterbalancing pull; this counterpull,</p>

<p class="pcontinue">which is necessary for equi­lib­rium, must therefore be provided
by the tensions existing in the <i>other two</i> surfaces of contact. In
short, if we could imagine a single particle placed at the very point
of contact, it would be drawn upon by three different forces,
whose directions would lie in the three surface planes, and whose
magnitude would be proportional to the specific tensions char­ac­ter­is­tic
of the two bodies which in each case combine to form the
“interfacial” surface. Now for three forces acting at a point to
be in equi­lib­rium, they must be capable of representation, in
magnitude and direction, by the three sides of a triangle, taken in
order, in accordance with the elementary theorem of the Triangle
of Forces. So, if we know the form of our floating drop (Fig. <a href="#fig100" title="go to Fig. 100">100</a>),
then by drawing tangents from <i>O</i> (the point
of mutual contact), <span class="xxpn" id="p296">{296}</span>
we determine the three angles of our triangle (Fig. <a href="#fig101" title="go to Fig. 101">101</a>), and we
therefore know the relative magnitudes of the three surface
tensions, which magnitudes are proportional to its sides; and
conversely, if we know the magnitudes, or relative magnitudes,
of the three sides of the triangle, we also know its angles, and these
determine the form of the section of the drop. It is scarcely
necessary to mention that, since all points on the edge of the
drop are under similar conditions, one with another, the form of
the drop, as we look down upon it from above, must be circular,
and the whole drop must be a solid of revolution.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<div class="dmaths">
<p>The principle of the Triangle of Forces is expanded, as follows,
by an old seventeenth-century theorem, called Lami’s Theorem:
“<i>If three forces acting at a point be in equi­lib­rium, each force is
proportional to the sine of the angle contained between the directions
of the other two.</i>” That is to say</p>

<div><i>P</i>&#x202f;:&#x202f;<i>Q</i>&#x202f;:&#x202f;<i>R</i>
:&#x202f;=&#x202f;sin&#x202f;<i>QOR</i>&#x202f;:&#x202f;sin&#x202f;<i>POR</i>&#x202f;:&#x202f;sin&#x202f;<i>POQ</i>.

=&#x202f;<i>R</i>&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;sin&#x202f;<i>POQ</i>.
<br class="brclrfix" /></div>

<p class="pcontinue">And from this, in turn, we derive the equivalent formulae, by
which each force is expressed in terms of the other two, and of the
angle between them:</p>

<div><i>P</i>&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup>
=&#x202f;<i>Q</i>&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup>&#x202f;+&#x202f;<i>R</i>&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup>&#x202f;+&#x202f;2&#x200a;<i>QR</i> cos(<i>QOR</i>), etc.
</div></div><!--dmaths-->

<p>From this and the foregoing, we learn the following important
and useful deductions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(1) The three forces can only be in equi­lib­rium when any one
of them is less than the sum of the other two: for otherwise, the
triangle is impossible. Now in the case of a drop of olive-oil
upon a clean water surface, the relative magnitudes of the three
tensions (at 15° C.) have been determined as follows:</p>

<div class="dtblbox"><div class="nowrap">
<table summary="">
<tr>
 <td class="tdleft">Water-air surface</td>
 <td class="tdright">75</td></tr>
<tr>
 <td class="tdleft">Oil-air surface</td>
 <td class="tdright">32</td></tr>
<tr>
 <td class="tdleft">Oil-water surface</td>
 <td class="tdright">21</td></tr>
</table></div></div><!--dtblbox-->

<p>No triangle having sides of these relative magnitudes is possible;
and no such drop therefore can
remain in equi­lib­rium. <span class="xxpn" id="p297">{297}</span></p></li>

<li><p>(2) The three surfaces may be all alike: as when a soap-bubble
floats upon soapy water, or when two soap-bubbles are
joined together, on either side of a partition-film. In this case,
the three tensions are all equal, and therefore the three angles
are all equal; that is to say, when three similar liquid surfaces
meet together, they always do so at an angle of 120°. Whether
our two conjoined soap-bubbles be equal or unequal, this is still
the invariable rule; because the specific tension of a particular
surface is unaffected by any changes of magnitude or form.</p></li>

<li><p>(3) If two only of the surfaces be alike, then two of the
angles will be alike, and the other will be unlike; and this last
will be the difference between 360° and the sum of the other two.
A particular case is when a film is stretched between solid and
parallel walls, like a soap-film within a cylindrical tube. Here, so
long as there is no external pressure applied to either side, so long
as both ends of the tube are open or closed, the angles on either
side of the film will be equal, that is to say the film will set itself
at right angles to the sides.</p>

<p>Many years ago Sachs laid it down as a principle, which has
become celebrated in botany under the name of Sachs’s Rule,
that one cell-wall always tends to set itself at right angles to another
cell-wall. This rule applies to the case which we have just illustrated;
and such validity as the rule possesses is due to the fact
that among plant-tissues it very frequently happens that one
cell-wall has become solid and rigid before another and later
partition-wall is developed in connection with it.</p></li>

<li><p>(4) There is another important principle which arises not
out of our equations but out of the general con­si­de­ra­tions
by which we were led to them. We have seen that, at and
near the point of contact between our several surfaces,
there is a continued balance of forces, carried, so to
speak, across the interval; in other words, there is
<i>physical continuity</i> between one surface and another. It
follows necessarily from this that the surfaces merge one
into another by a continuous curve. Whatever be the form
of our surfaces and whatever the angle between them, this
small intervening surface, ap­prox­i­mate­ly spherical, is
always there to bridge over the line of contact<a class="afnanch" href="#fn342" id="fnanch342">342</a>;
and
this little fillet, or “bourrelet,” <span class="xxpn" id="p298">{298}</span>
as Plateau called it, is large enough to be a common and conspicuous
feature in the microscopy of tissues (Fig. <a href="#fig102" title="go to Fig. 102">102</a>). For
instance, the so-called “splitting” of the cell-wall, which is conspicuous
at the angles of the large “parenchymatous” cells in the
succulent tissues of all higher plants (Fig. <a href="#fig103" title="go to Fig. 103">103</a>), is nothing more
than a manifestation of Plateau’s “bourrelet,” or surface of
continuity<a class="afnanch" href="#fn343" id="fnanch343">343</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>We may now illustrate some of the foregoing principles,
before we proceed to the more complex cases in which more
bodies than three are in mutual contact. But in doing so, we
must constantly bear in mind the principles set forth in our
chapter on the forms of cells, and especially those relating to the
pressure exercised by a curved film.</p>

<p>Let us look for a moment at the case presented by the partition-wall
in a double soap-bubble. As we have just seen, the three
films in contact (viz. the outer walls of the two bubbles and the
partition-wall between) being all composed
of the same substance <span class="xxpn" id="p299">{299}</span>
and all alike in contact with air, the three surface tensions must
be equal; and the three films must therefore, in all cases, meet
at an angle of 120°. But, unless the two bubbles be of precisely
equal size (and therefore of equal curvature) it is obvious that the
tangents to the spheres will not meet the plane of their circle
of contact at equal angles, and therefore that the partition-wall
must be a <i>curved</i> surface: it is only plane when it divides two
equal and symmetrical cells. It is also obvious, from the symmetry
of the figure, that the centres of the spheres, the centre of
the partition, and the centres of the two spherical surfaces are
all on one and the same straight line.</p>

<div class="dctr01" id="fig104">
<img src="images/i299.png" width="800" height="202" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 104.</div></div>

<p>Now the surfaces of the two bubbles exert a pressure inwards
which is inversely proportional to their radii: that is to say
<i>p</i>&#x202f;:&#x202f;<i>p&#xfeff;′</i>&#x202f;::&#x202f;1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>r&#xfeff;′</i>&#x202f;:&#x202f;1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>r</i>;
and the partition wall must, for equi­lib­rium,
exert a pressure (<i>P</i>) which is equal to the difference between these
two pressures, that is to say,
<i>P</i>
=&#x202f;1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>R</i>
=&#x202f;1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>r&#xfeff;′</i>&#x202f;−&#x202f;1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>r</i>
<span class="nowrap">
=&#x202f;(<i>r</i>&#x202f;−&#x202f;<i>r&#xfeff;′</i>)&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>r&#x200a;r&#xfeff;′</i>.</span> It
follows that the curvature of the partition wall must be just such
a curvature as is capable of exerting this pressure, that is to say,
<i>R</i> <span class="nowrap">
=&#x202f;<i>r&#x200a;r&#xfeff;′</i>&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;(<i>r</i>&#x202f;−&#x202f;<i>r&#xfeff;′</i>).</span>
The partition wall, then, is always a portion of
a spherical surface, whose radius is equal to the product, divided
by the difference, of the radii of the two vesicles. It follows at
once from this that if the two bubbles be equal, the radius of
curvature of the partition is infinitely great, that is to say the
partition is (as we have already seen) a plane surface.</p>

<p>The geometrical construction by which we obtain the position
of the centres of the two spheres and also of the partition surface
is very simple, always provided that the surface tensions are
uniform throughout the system. If <i>p</i> be a point of contact
between the two spheres, and <i>cp</i> be a radius of one of them, then
make the angle <i>cpm</i>
=&#x202f;60°, and mark off on <i>pm</i>, <i>pc&#xfeff;′</i>
equal to the <span class="xxpn" id="p300">{300}</span>
radius of the other sphere; in like manner, make the angle
<i>c&#xfeff;′pn</i>
=&#x202f;60°, cutting the line <i>cc&#xfeff;′</i> in <i>c&#xfeff;″</i>; then <i>c&#xfeff;′</i> will be the centre
of the second sphere, and <i>c&#xfeff;″</i> that of the spherical partition.</p>

<p>Whether the partition be or be not a plane surface, it is obvious
that its <i>line of junction</i> with the rest of the system lies in a plane,
and is at right angles to the axis of symmetry. The actual
curvature of the partition-wall is easily seen in optical section;
but in surface view, the line of junction is <i>projected</i> as a plane
(Fig. <a href="#fig106" title="go to Fig. 106">106</a>), perpendicular to the axis, and this appearance has
also helped to lend support and authority to “Sachs’s Rule.”</p>

<p>Many spherical cells, such as
Protococcus, divide into two equal
halves, which are therefore separated
by a plane partition. Among
the other lower Algae, akin to
Protococcus, such as the Nostocs
and Oscillatoriae, in which the
cells are imbedded in a gelatinous
matrix, we find a series of forms
such as are represented in Fig. <a href="#fig107" title="go to Fig. 107">107</a>.
Sometimes the cells are solitary
or disunited; sometimes they run
in pairs or in rows, separated one
from another by flat partitions;
and sometimes the conjoined cells
are ap­prox­i­mate­ly hemispherical, but at other times each half
is more than a hemisphere. These
various conditions depend, <span class="xxpn" id="p301">{301}</span>
according to what we have already learned, upon the relative

<div class="dmaths">
<p>In the typical case of an equally divided cell, such as a double
and co-equal soap-bubble, where the partition-wall and the outer
walls are similar to one another and in contact with similar substances,
we can easily determine the form of the system. For, at
any point of the boundary of the partition-wall, <i>O</i>, the tensions
being equal, the angles <i>QOP</i>, <i>ROP</i>, <i>QOR</i> are all equal, and each
is, therefore, an angle of 120°. But <i>OQ</i>, <i>OR</i> being tangents, the
centres of the two spheres (or circular arcs in the figure) lie on
perpendiculars to them; therefore the radii <i>CO</i>, <i>C&#xfeff;′O</i> meet at an</p>

equilateral triangle. That is to say, the centre of
each circle lies on the circumference of the other; the
partition lies midway between the two centres; and the
length (i.e. the diameter) of the partition-wall, <i>PO</i>,
is</p>

<p>As soon as the tensions become unequal, whether from changes
in their own substance or from differences in the substances with
which they are in contact, then the form alters.
If the tension <span class="xxpn" id="p302">{302}</span>
along the partition, <i>P</i>, diminishes, the partition itself enlarges,
and the angle <i>QOR</i> increases: until, when the tension <i>P</i> is very
small compared to <i>Q</i> or <i>R</i>, the whole figure becomes a circle, and
the partition-wall, dividing it into two hemispheres, stands at
right angles to the outer wall. This is the case when the outer
wall of the cell is practically solid. On the other hand, if <i>P</i> begins
to increase relatively to <i>Q</i> and <i>R</i>, then the partition-wall contracts,
and the two adjacent cells become larger and larger segments of
a sphere, until at length the system becomes divided into two
separate cells.</p>

two equal halves, and is therefore a plane surface, normal to the
surface of the cell; but the next partitions arise near to either

cell-wall; at least the angles on either side of the partition will

solid, and in all probability (rigidity of the cell-wall not being
quite attained) they will be somewhat greater. In either case
the partition itself will be a portion of a sphere, whose curvature
will now denote a difference of pressures in the two chambers or
cells, which it serves to separate. (The later stages of cell-division,
represented in the figures <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>, we are not yet in a position to
deal with.)</p>

<p>We have innumerable cases, near the tip of a growing filament,
where in like manner the partition-wall which cuts
off the terminal <span class="xxpn" id="p303">{303}</span>
cell constitutes a spherical lens-shaped surface, set normally to
the adjacent walls. At the tips of the branches of many Florideae,
for instance, we find such a lenticular partition. In <i>Dictyota
dichotoma</i>, as figured by Reinke, we have a succession of such
partitions; and, by the way, in such cases as these, where the
tissues are very transparent, we have often in optical section a
puzzling confusion of lines; one being the optical section of the
curved partition-wall, the other being the straight linear projection
of its outer edge to which we have already referred. In the
conical terminal cell of Chara, we have the same lens-shaped
curve, but a little lower down, where the sides of the shoot are
ap­prox­i­mate­ly parallel, we have flat transverse partitions, at the
edges of which, however, we recognise a convexity of the outer
cell-wall and a definite angle of contact, equal on the two sides
of the partition.</p>

<p>In the young antheridia of Chara (Fig. <a href="#fig112" title="go to Fig. 112">112</a>), and in the not
dissimilar case of the sporangium (or conidiophore) of Mucor, we
easily recognise the hemispherical form of the septum which shuts
off the large spherical cell from the cylindrical
filament. Here, in the first phase of development,
we should have to take into consideration
the different pressures exerted by the single
curvature of the cylinder and the double
curvature of its spherical cap (p. <a href="#p221" title="go to pg. 221">221</a>); and
we should find that the partition would have
a somewhat low curvature, with a radius <i>less</i>
than the diameter of the cylinder; which it
would have exactly equalled but for the
additional pressure inwards
which it receives <span class="xxpn" id="p304">{304}</span>
from the curvature of the large surrounding sphere. But as the
latter continues to grow, its curvature decreases, and so likewise
does the inward pressure of its surface; and accordingly the little
convex partition bulges out more and more.

<p>In order to epitomise the foregoing facts let the annexed

one is a partition-wall between the other two; and let the tensions

their meeting-place, be proportional to <i>T</i>, <i>T&#xfeff;′</i> and <i>t</i>. Let α, β, γ
be, as in the figure, the opposite angles. Then:</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The biological facts which the foregoing con­si­de­ra­tions go a
long way to explain and account for have been the subject of much
argument and discussion, especially on the part of the botanists.
Let me recapitulate, in a very few words, the history of this long
discussion.</p>

<p>Some fifty years ago, Hofmeister laid it down as a general law
that “The partition-wall stands always perpendicular to what was
previously the principal direction of growth in the cell,”—or, in
other words, perpendicular to the long axis
of the cell<a class="afnanch" href="#fn345" id="fnanch345">345</a>.
Ten <span class="xxpn" id="p305">{305}</span>
years later, Sachs formulated his rule, or principle, of “rectangular
section,” declaring that in all tissues, however complex, the
cell-walls cut one another (at the time of their formation) at right
angles<a class="afnanch" href="#fn346" id="fnanch346">346</a>.
Years before, Schwendener had found, in the final
results of cell-division, a universal system of “orthogonal trajectories<a class="afnanch" href="#fn347" id="fnanch347">347</a>”;
and this idea Sachs further developed, introducing
complicated systems of confocal ellipses and hyperbolæ, and
distinguishing between periclinal walls, whose curves ap­prox­i­mate
to the peripheral contours, radial partitions, which cut these at
an angle of 90°, and finally anticlines, which stand at right angles
to the other two.</p>

<p>Reinke, in 1880, was the first to throw some doubt upon this
explanation. He pointed out various cases where the angle was
not a right angle, but was very definitely an acute one; and
he saw, apparently, in the more common rectangular symmetry
merely what he calls a necessary, but <i>secondary</i>, result of growth<a class="afnanch" href="#fn348" id="fnanch348">348</a>.</p>

<p>Within the next few years, a number of botanical writers were
content to point out further exceptions to Sachs’s Rule<a class="afnanch" href="#fn349" id="fnanch349">349</a>;
and in
some cases to show that the <i>curvatures</i> of the partition-walls,
especially such cases of lenticular curvature as we have described,
were by no means accounted for by either Hofmeister or Sachs;
while within the same period, Sachs himself, and also Rauber,
attempted to extend the main generalisation to animal tissues<a class="afnanch" href="#fn350" id="fnanch350">350</a>.</p>

<p>While these writers regarded the form and arrangement of the
cell-walls as a biological phenomenon, with little if any direct
relation to ordinary physical laws, or with but a vague reference
to “mechanical conditions,” the physical side of the case was
soon urged by others, with more or less force and cogency. Indeed
the general resemblance between a cellular
tissue and a “froth” <span class="xxpn" id="p306">{306}</span>
had been pointed out long before, by Melsens, who had made an
“artificial tissue” by blowing into a solution of white of egg<a class="afnanch" href="#fn351" id="fnanch351">351</a>.</p>

<p>In 1886, Berthold published his <i>Protoplasmamechanik</i>, in which
he definitely adopted the principle of “minimal areas,” and,
following on the lines of Plateau, compared the forms of many
cell-surfaces and the arrangement of their partitions with those
assumed under surface tension by a system of “weightless films.”
But, as Klebs<a class="afnanch" href="#fn352" id="fnanch352">352</a>
points out in reviewing Berthold’s book, Berthold
was careful to stop short of attributing the biological phenomena
to a definite mechanical cause. They remained for him, as they
had done for Sachs, so many “phenomena of growth,” or
“properties of protoplasm.”</p>

<p>In the same year, but while still apparently unacquainted with
Berthold’s work, Errera<a class="afnanch" href="#fn353" id="fnanch353">353</a>
published a short but very lucid article,
in which he definitely ascribed to the cell-wall (as Hofmeister had
already done) the properties of a semi-liquid film and drew from
this as a logical consequence the deduction that it <i>must</i> assume the
various con­fi­gur­a­tions which the law of minimal areas imposes on
the soap-bubble. So what we may call <i>Errera’s Law</i> is formulated
as follows: A cellular membrane, at the moment of its formation,
tends to assume the form which would be assumed, under the
same conditions, by a liquid film destitute of weight.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards Chabry, in discussing the embryology of the
Ascidians, indicated many of the points in which the contacts
between cells repeat the surface-tension phenomena of the soap-bubble,
and came to the conclusion that part, at least, of the
embryological phenomena were purely physical<a class="afnanch" href="#fn354" id="fnanch354">354</a>;
and the same
line of in­ves­ti­ga­tion and thought were pursued and developed by
Robert, in connection with the embryology of the Mollusca<a class="afnanch" href="#fn355" id="fnanch355">355</a>.
Driesch again, in a series of papers, continued to draw attention
to the presence of capillary phenomena in
the segmenting cells <span class="xxpn" id="p307">{307}</span>
of various embryos, and came to the conclusion that the mode of
segmentation was of little importance as regards the final result<a class="afnanch" href="#fn356" id="fnanch356">356</a>.</p>

<p>Lastly de Wildeman<a class="afnanch" href="#fn357" id="fnanch357">357</a>,
in a somewhat wider, but also vaguer
generalisation than Errera’s, declared that “The form of the
cellular framework of vegetables, and also of animals, in its
essential features, depends upon the forces of molecular physics.”</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Let us return to our problem of the arrangement of partition
films. When we have three bubbles in contact, instead of two as
in the case already considered, the phenomenon is strictly analogous
to our former case. The three bubbles will be separated by three
partition surfaces, whose curvature will depend upon the relative</p>

<div class="dctr01" id="fig114">
<img src="images/i307.png" width="800" height="389" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 114.</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">size
of the spheres, and which will be plane if the latter are all of
the same dimensions; but whether plane or curved, the three
partitions will meet one another at an angle of 120°, in an axial
line. Various pretty geometrical corollaries accompany this arrangement.
For instance, if Fig. <a href="#fig114" title="go to Fig. 114">114</a> represent the three associated
bubbles in a plane drawn through their centres, <i>c</i>, <i>c&#xfeff;′</i>, <i>c&#xfeff;″</i> (or what
is the same thing, if it represent the base of three bubbles resting
on a plane), then the lines <i>uc</i>, <i>uc&#xfeff;″</i>, or <i>sc</i>, <i>sc&#xfeff;′</i>,
etc., drawn to the <span class="xxpn" id="p308">{308}</span>
centres from the points of intersection of the circular arcs, will
always enclose an angle of 60°. Again (Fig. <a href="#fig115" title="go to Fig. 115">115</a>), if we make the
angle <i>c&#xfeff;″uf</i> equal to 60°, and produce <i>uf</i> to meet <i>cc&#xfeff;″</i> in <i>f</i>, <i>f</i> will be
the centre of the circular arc which constitutes the partition <i>Ou</i>;
and further, the three points <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, successively determined in this</p>

<div class="dctr05" id="fig115">
<img src="images/i308.png" width="481" height="910" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 115.</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">manner, will lie on one and the same straight line. In the case
of coequal bubbles or cells (as in Fig. <a href="#fig114" title="go to Fig. 114">114</a>, B), it is obvious that
the lines joining their centres form an equilateral triangle; and
consequently, that the centre of each circle (or sphere) lies on the
circumference of the other two; it is also obvious that
<i>uf</i> is now <span class="xxpn" id="p309">{309}</span>
parallel to <i>cc&#xfeff;″</i>, and accordingly that the centre of curvature of
the partition is now infinitely distant, or (as we have already said),
that the partition itself is plane.</p>

<p>When we have four bubbles in conjunction, they would seem
to be capable of arrangement in two symmetrical ways: either,
as in Fig. <a href="#fig116" title="go to Fig. 116">116</a> (A), with the four partition-walls meeting at right
angles, or, as in (B), with <i>five</i> partitions meeting, three and three,
at angles of 120°. This latter arrangement is strictly analogous
to the arrangement of three bubbles in Fig. <a href="#fig114" title="go to Fig. 114">114</a>. Now, though
both of these figures, from their symmetry, are apparently figures of
equi­lib­rium, yet, physically, the former turns out to be of unstable</p>

<div class="dctr01" id="fig116">
<img src="images/i309.png" width="800" height="482" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 116.</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">and the latter of stable equi­lib­rium.
If we try to bring our four bubbles into the form of Fig.
<a href="#fig116" title="go to Fig. 116">116</a>, A, such an arrangement endures only for an instant;
the partitions glide upon each other, a median wall springs
into existence, and the system at once assumes the form
of our second figure (B). This is a direct consequence of
the law of minimal areas: for it can be shewn, by somewhat
difficult mathematics (as was first done by Lamarle),
that, in dividing a closed space into a given number of
chambers by means of partition-walls, the least possible
area of these partition-walls, taken together, can only
be attained when they meet together in groups of three,
at equal angles, that is to say at angles of 120°. <span
class="xxpn" id="p310">{310}</span></p>

<p>Wherever we have a true cellular complex, an arrangement of
cells in actual physical contact by means of a boundary film, we
find this general principle in force; we must only bear in mind
that, for its perfect recognition, we must be able to view the
object in a plane at right angles to the boundary walls. For
instance, in any ordinary section of a vegetable parenchyma, we
recognise the appearance of a “froth,” precisely resembling that
which we can construct by imprisoning a mass of soap-bubbles in
a narrow vessel with flat sides of glass; in both cases we see the
cell-walls everywhere meeting, by threes, at angles of 120°, irrespective
of the size of the individual cells: whose relative size, on
the other hand, determines the <i>curvature</i> of the partition-walls.
On the surface of a honey-comb we have precisely the same
conjunction, between cell and cell, of three boundary walls,
meeting at 120°. In embryology, when we examine a segmenting
egg, of four (or more) segments, we find in like manner, in the great
majority of cases, if not in all, that the same principle is still
exemplified; the four segments do not meet in a common centre,
but each cell is in contact with two others, and the three, and only
three, common boundary walls meet at the normal angle of 120°.
A so-called <i>polar furrow</i><a class="afnanch" href="#fn358" id="fnanch358">358</a>,
the visible edge of a vertical partition-wall,
joins (or separates) the two triple contacts, precisely as in
Fig. <a href="#fig116" title="go to Fig. 116">116</a>, B.</p>

<p>In the four-celled stage of the frog’s egg, Rauber (an exceptionally
careful observer) shews us three alternative modes in which
the four cells may be found to be conjoined (Fig. <a href="#fig117" title="go to Fig. 117">117</a>). In (A) we
have the commonest arrangement, which is that which we have
just studied and found to be the simplest theoretical one; that
namely where a straight “polar furrow” intervenes, and where,
at its extremities, the partition-walls are conjoined three by three.
In (B), we have again a polar furrow, which is now seen to be a
portion of the first “segmentation-furrow” (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig155" title="go to Fig. 155">155</a> etc.) by
which the egg was originally divided into two; the four-celled
stage being reached by the appearance of
the transverse furrows <span class="xxpn" id="p311">{311}</span>
and their cor­re­spon­ding partitions. In this case, the polar
furrow is seen to be sinuously curved, and Rauber tells us that
its curvature gradually alters: as a matter of fact, it (or rather
the partition-wall cor­re­spon­ding to it) is gradually setting itself
into a position of equi­lib­rium, that is to say of equiangular contact
with its neighbours, which position of equi­lib­rium is already
attained or nearly so in Fig. <a href="#fig117" title="go to Fig. 117">117</a>, A. In Fig. <a href="#fig117" title="go to Fig. 117">117</a>, C, we have a
very different condition, with which we shall deal in a moment.</p>

<div class="dctr03" id="fig117">

 <div class="pcaption">Fig. 117. Various ways in which the four
 cells are co-arranged in the four-celled stage of the
 frog’s egg. (After Rauber.)</div></div>

<p>According to the relative magnitude of the bodies in contact,
this “polar furrow” may be longer or shorter, and it may be so
minute as to be not easily discernible; but it is quite certain that
no simple and homogeneous system of fluid films such as we
are dealing with is in equi­lib­rium without its presence. In the
accounts given, however, by embryologists of the segmentation of
the egg, while the polar furrow is depicted in the great majority
of cases, there are others in which it has not been seen and some
in which its absence is definitely asserted<a class="afnanch" href="#fn359" id="fnanch359">359</a>.
The cases where four
cells, lying in one plane, meet <i>in a point</i>, such as were frequently
figured by the older embryologists, are very difficult to verify,
and I have not come across a single clear case in recent literature.
Considering the physical stability of the other arrangement, the
great preponderance of cases in which it is known to occur, the
difficulty of recognising the polar furrow in cases where it is
very small and unless it be specially looked for, and the natural
tendency of the draughtsman to make an all but symmetrical
structure appear wholly so, I am much
inclined to attribute to <span class="xxpn" id="p312">{312}</span>
error or imperfect observation all those cases where the junction-lines
of four cells are represented (after the manner of Fig. <a href="#fig116" title="go to Fig. 116">116</a>, A)
as a simple cross<a class="afnanch" href="#fn360" id="fnanch360">360</a>.</p>

<p>But while a true four-rayed intersection, or simple cross, is
theoretically impossible (save as a transitory and highly unstable
condition), there is another condition which may closely simulate
it, and which is common enough. There are plenty of representations
of segmenting eggs, in which, instead of the triple
junction and polar furrow, the four cells (and in like manner their
more numerous successors) are represented as <i>rounded off</i>, and
separated from one another by an empty space, or by a little drop
of an extraneous fluid, evidently not directly miscible with the
fluid surfaces of the cells. Such is the case in the obviously
accurate figure which Rauber gives (Fig. <a href="#fig117" title="go to Fig. 117">117</a>, C) of the third mode
of conjunction in the four-celled stage of the frog’s egg. Here
Rauber is most careful to point out that the furrows do not simply
“cross,” or meet in a point, but are separated by a little space,
which he calls the <i>Polgrübchen</i>, and asserts to be constantly present
whensoever the polar furrow, or <i>Brechungslinie</i>, is not to be
discerned. This little interposed space, with its contained drop
of fluid, materially alters the case, and implies a new condition
of theoretical and actual equi­lib­rium. For, on the one hand, we
see that now the four intercellular partitions do not meet <i>one
another at all</i>; but really impinge upon four new and separate
partitions, which constitute interfacial contacts, not between cell
and cell, but between the respective cells and the intercalated
drop. And secondly, the angles at which these four little surfaces
will meet the four cell-partitions, will be determined, in the usual
way, by the balance between the respective tensions of these several
surfaces. In an extreme case (as in some pollen-grains) it may be
found that the cells under the observed circumstances are not truly
in surface contact: that they are so many drops which touch but
do not “wet” one another, and which are merely held together
by the pressure of the surrounding envelope.
But even supposing, <span class="xxpn" id="p313">{313}</span>
as is in all probability the actual case, that they are in actual fluid
contact, the case from the point of view of surface tension presents
no difficulty. In the case of the conjoined soap-bubbles, we were
dealing with <i>similar</i> contacts and with <i>equal</i> surface tensions throughout
the system; but in the system of protoplasmic cells which
constitute the segmenting egg we must make allowance for <i>an inequality</i>
of tensions, between the surfaces where cell meets cell, and
where on the other hand cell-surface is in contact with the surrounding
medium,—in this case generally water or one of the fluids
of the body. Remember that our general condition is that, in our entire</p>

<div class="dright dwth-d" id="fig118">
<img src="images/i313.png" width="366" height="266" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 118.</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">system, the <i>sum of the surface energies</i> is a minimum; and,
while this is attained by the <i>sum
of the surfaces</i> being a minimum
in the case where the energy is
uniformly distributed, it is not
necessarily so under non-uniform
conditions. In the diagram (Fig.
<a href="#fig118" title="go to Fig. 118">118</a>) if the energy per unit area
be greater along the contact
surface <i>cc&#xfeff;′</i>, where cell meets cell,
than along <i>ca</i> or <i>cb</i>, where cell-surface
is in contact with the surrounding medium, these latter
surfaces will tend to increase and the surface of cell-contact
to diminish. In short there will be the usual balance of forces
between the tension along the surface <i>cc&#xfeff;′</i>, and the two opposing
tensions along <i>ca</i> and <i>cb</i>. If the former be greater than either
of the other two, the outside angle will be less than 120°; and if
the tension along the surface <i>cc&#xfeff;′</i> be as much or more than the
sum of the other two, then the drops will stand in contact only,
save for the possible effect of external pressure, at a point. This is
the explanation, in general terms, of the peculiar conditions
obtaining in Nostoc and its allies (p. <a href="#p300" title="go to pg. 300">300</a>), and it also leads us to
a consideration of the general properties and characters of an
“epidermal” layer.<br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>While the inner cells of the honey-comb are symmetrically
situated, sharing with their neighbours in equally distributed
pressures or tensions, and therefore all tending
with great accuracy <span class="xxpn" id="p314">{314}</span>
to identity of form, the case is obviously different with the cells
at the borders of the system. So it is, in like manner, with our
froth of soap-bubbles. The bubbles, or cells, in the interior of
the mass are all alike in general character, and if they be equal
in size are alike in every respect: their sides are uniformly
flattened<a class="afnanch" href="#fn361" id="fnanch361">361</a>,
and tend to meet at equal angles of 120°. But the
bubbles which constitute the outer layer retain their spherical
surfaces, which however still tend to meet the partition-walls
connected with them at constant angles of 120°. This outer layer
of bubbles, which forms the surface of our froth, constitutes after
a fashion what we should call in botany an “epidermal” layer.
But in our froth of soap-bubbles we have, as a rule, the same kind
of contact (that is to say, contact with <i>air</i>) both within and without
the bubbles; while in our living cell, the outer wall of the epidermal
cell is exposed to air on the one side, but is in contact with the</p>

<div class="dctr04" id="fig119">
<img src="images/i314.png" width="483" height="191" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 119.</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">protoplasm of the cell on the other: and this involves a difference
of tensions, so that the outer walls and their adjacent partitions
are no longer likely to meet at equal angles of 120°. Moreover,
a chemical change, due for instance to oxidation or possibly also
to adsorption, is very likely to affect the external wall, and may
tend to its consolidation; and this process, as we have seen, is
tantamount to a large increase, and at the same time an
equalisation, of tension in that outer wall, and will lead the
adjacent partitions to impinge upon it at angles more and
more nearly approximating to 90°: the bubble-like, or spherical,
surfaces of the individual cells being more and more flattened
in consequence. Lastly, the chemical changes which affect the
outer walls of the superficial cells may extend, in greater or
less degree, to their inner walls also: with the
result that these <span class="xxpn" id="p315">{315}</span>
cells will tend to become more or less rectangular throughout, and
will cease to dovetail into the interstices of the next subjacent
layer. These then are the general characters which we recognise
in an epidermis; and we perceive that the fundamental character
of an epidermis simply is that it lies on the outside, and that its
main physical char­ac­teris­tics follow, as a matter of course, from
the position which it occupies and from the various consequences
which that situation entails. We have however by no means
exhausted the subject in this short account; for the botanist is
accustomed to draw a sharp distinction between a true epidermis
and what is called epidermal tissue. The latter, which is found in
such a sea-weed as Laminaria and in very many other cryptogamic
plants, consists, as in the hypothetical case we have described,
of a more or less simple and direct modification of the general or
fundamental tissue. But a “true epidermis,” such as we have it
in the higher plants, is something with a long morphological history,
something which has been laid down or differentiated in an early
stage of the plant’s growth, and which afterwards retains its
separate and independent character. We shall see presently that
a physical reason is again at hand to account, under certain
circumstances, for the early partitioning off, from a mass of
embryonic tissue, of an outer layer of cells which from their first
appearance are marked off from the rest by their rectangular and
flattened form.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>We have hitherto considered our cells, or bubbles, as lying in
a plane of symmetry, and further, we have only considered the
appearance which they present as projected on that plane: in
simpler words, we have been considering their appearance in
surface or in sectional view. But we have further to consider
them as solids, whether they be still grouped in relation to a single
plane (like the four cells in Fig. <a href="#fig116" title="go to Fig. 116">116</a>) or heaped upon one another,
as for instance in a tetrahedral form like four cannon-balls; and in
either case we have to pass from the problems of plane to those of
solid geometry. In short, the further development of our theme
must lead us along two paths of enquiry, which continually
intercross, namely (1) the study of more complex cases of partition
and of contact in a plane, and (2) the whole question
of the surfaces <span class="xxpn" id="p316">{316}</span>
and angles presented by solid figures in symmetrical juxtaposition.
Let us take a simple case of the latter kind, and again afterwards,
so far as possible, let us try to keep the two themes separate.</p>

<p>Where we have three spheres in contact, as in Fig. <a href="#fig114" title="go to Fig. 114">114</a> or in
either half of Fig. <a href="#fig116" title="go to Fig. 116">116</a>, B, let us consider the point of contact
(<i>O</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig114" title="go to Fig. 114">114</a>) not as a point in the plane section of the diagram, but
as a point where three <i>furrows</i> meet on the surface of the system.
At this point, <i>three cells</i> meet; but it is also obvious that there meet
here <i>six surfaces</i>, namely the outer, spherical walls of the three
bubbles, and the three partition-walls which divide them, two and
two. Also, <i>four</i> lines or <i>edges</i> meet here; viz. the three external arcs
which form the outer boundaries of the partition-walls (and which
correspond to what we commonly call the “furrows” in the segmenting
egg); and as a fourth edge, the “arris” or junction of the
three partitions (perpendicular to the plane of the paper), where
they all three meet together, as we have seen, at equal angles of
120°. Lastly, there meet at the point <i>four solid angles</i>, each
bounded by three surfaces: to wit, within each bubble a solid
angle bounded by two partition-walls and by the surface wall;
and (fourthly) an external solid angle bounded by the outer
surfaces of all three bubbles. Now in the case of the soap-bubbles
(whose surfaces are all in contact with air, both outside and in),
the six films meeting at the point, whether surface films or partition
films, are all similar, with similar tensions. In other words the
tensions, or forces, acting at the point are all similar and symmetrically
arranged, and it at once follows from this that the angles,
solid as well as plane, are all equal. It is also obvious that, as
regards the point of contact, the system will still be symmetrical,
and its symmetry will be quite unchanged, if we add a fourth
bubble in contact with the other three: that is to say, if where
we had merely the outer air before, we now replace it by the air
in the interior of another bubble. The only difference will be that
the pressure exercised by the walls of this fourth bubble will alter
the curvature of the surfaces of the others, so far as it encloses
them; and, if all four bubbles be identical in size, these surfaces
which formerly we called external and which have now come to
be internal partitions, will, like the others, be flattened by equal
and opposite pressure, into planes. We are now
dealing, in short, <span class="xxpn" id="p317">{317}</span>
with six planes, meeting symmetrically in a point, and constituting
there four equal solid angles.</p>

<p>If we make a wire cage, in the form of a regular tetrahedron,
and dip it into soap-solution, then when we withdraw it we see
that to each one of the six edges of the tetrahedron, i.e. to each
one of the six wires which constitute the little cage, a film has
attached itself; and these six films meet internally at a point, and
constitute in every respect the symmetrical figure which we have
just been describing. In short, the system of films we have
hereby automatically produced is precisely the system of partition-walls
which exist in our tetrahedral aggregation of four spherical
bubbles:—precisely the same, that is to say, in the neighbourhood
of the meeting-point, and only differing in that we have made the
wires of our tetrahedron straight, instead of imitating the circular
arcs which actually form the intersections of our bubbles. This
detail we can easily introduce in our wire model if we please.</p>

<div class="dmaths">
<p>Let us look for a moment at the geometry of our figure. Let <i>o</i>
(Fig. <a href="#fig120" title="go to Fig. 120">120</a>) be the centre of the tetrahedron, i.e. the centre of symmetry
where our films meet; and let <i>oa</i>, <i>ob</i>, <i>oc</i>, <i>od</i>, be lines drawn to
the four corners of the tetrahedron. Produce <i>ao</i> to meet the base
in <i>p</i>; then <i>apd</i> is a right-angled triangle. It is not difficult to
prove that in such a figure, <i>o</i> (the centre of gravity
of the system) <span class="xxpn" id="p318">{318}</span>
lies just three-quarters of the way between an apex, <i>a</i>, and a point,
<i>p</i>, which is the centre of gravity of the opposite base. Therefore</p>

<div><i>op</i>
=&#x202f;<i>oa</i>&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;3

=&#x202f;−&#x200a;1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;3.</div>
</div><!--dmaths-->

<p>That is to say, the angle <i>aod</i> is just, as nearly as possible,
109°&#x202f;28&#xfeff;′&#x202f;16&#xfeff;″. This angle, then, of 109°&#x202f;28&#xfeff;′&#x202f;16&#xfeff;″, or very nearly
109 degrees and a half, is the angle at which, in this and <i>every
other solid system</i> of liquid films, the edges of the partition-walls
meet one another at a point. It is the fundamental angle in the
solid geometry of our systems, just as 120° was the fundamental
angle of symmetry so long as we considered only the plane projection,
or plane section, of three films meeting in an edge.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Out of these two angles, we may construct a great variety of
figures, plane and solid, which become all the more varied and
complex when, by considering the case of unequal as well as equal
cells, we admit curved (e.g. spherical) as well as plane boundary
surfaces. Let us consider some examples and illustrations of
these, beginning with those which we need only consider in reference
to a plane.</p>

<p>Let us imagine a system of equal cylinders, or equal spheres,
in contact with one another in a plane, and represented in section
by the equal and contiguous circles of Fig. <a href="#fig121" title="go to Fig. 121">121</a>. I borrow my
figure, by the way, from an old Italian naturalist, Bonanni (a
contemporary of Borelli, of Hay and Willoughby and of Martin
Lister), who dealt with this matter in a book chiefly devoted to
molluscan shells<a class="afnanch" href="#fn362" id="fnanch362">362</a>.</p>

<p>It is obvious, as a simple geometrical fact, that each of these
equal circles is in contact with six surrounding circles. Imagine
now that the whole system comes under some uniform stress.
It may be of uniform surface tension at the boundaries of all the
cells; it may be of pressure caused by uniform growth or expansion
within the cells; or it may be due to some uniformly applied
constricting pressure from without. In all of these cases the <i>points</i>
of contact between the circles in the diagram
will be extended into <span class="xxpn" id="p319">{319}</span>
<i>lines</i> of contact, representing <i>surfaces</i> of contact in the actual
spheres or cylinders; and the equal circles of our diagram will
be converted into regular and equal hexagons. The angles of
these hexagons, at each of which three hexagons meet, are of
course angles of 120°. So far as the form is concerned, so long as
we are concerned only with a morphological result and not with
a physiological process, the result is precisely the same whatever
be the force which brings the bodies together in symmetrical
apposition; it is by no means necessary for us, in the first instance,
even to enquire whether it be surface tension or mechanical
pressure or some other physical force which is the cause, or the
main cause, of the phenomenon.</p>

<p>The production by mutual interaction of polyhedral cells,
which, under conditions of perfect symmetry, become regular
hexagons, is very beautifully illustrated by Prof. Bénard’s
“<i>tourbillons cellulaires</i>” (cf. p. 259), and also in some of Leduc’s
diffusion experiments. A weak (5 per cent.) solution of gelatine
is allowed to set on a plate of glass, and little drops of a 5 or
10 per cent. solution of ferrocyanide of potassium are then placed
at regular intervals upon the gelatine. Immediately each little
drop becomes the centre, or pole, of a system
of diffusion currents, <span class="xxpn" id="p320">{320}</span>
and the several systems conflict with and repel one another, so
that presently each little area becomes the seat of a double current
system, from its centre outwards and back again; until at length
the concentration of the field becomes equalised
and the currents <span class="xxpn" id="p321">{321}</span></p>

mass is permitted to dry, we have an artificial tissue of more or
less regularly hexagonal “cells,” which simulate in the closest way
an organic parenchyma. And by varying the experiment, in ways
which Leduc describes, we may simulate various forms of tissue,
and produce cells with thick walls or with thin, cells in close
contact or with wide intercellular spaces, cells with plane or with
curved partitions, and so forth.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The hexagonal pattern is illustrated among organisms in countless
cases, but those in which the pattern is perfectly regular, by
reason of perfect uniformity of force and perfect equality of the
individual cells, are not so numerous. The hexagonal epithelium-cells
of the pigment layer of the eye, external to the retina, are
a good example. Here we have a single layer of uniform cells,
reposing on the one hand upon a basement membrane, supported</p>

<p class="pcontinue">behind by the solid
wall of the sclerotic, and exposed on the other
hand to the uniform fluid pressure of the vitreous humour. The
conditions all point, and lead, to a perfectly symmetrical result:
that is to say, the cells, uniform in size, are flattened out to a
uniform thickness by the fluid pressure acting radially; and their
reaction on each other converts the flattened discs into regular
hexagons. In an ordinary columnar epithelium, such as that of
the intestine, we see again that the columnar cells have been
compressed into hexagonal prisms; but here as a rule the cells
are less uniform in size, small cells are apt to be intercalated
among the larger, and the perfect symmetry is accordingly lost.
The same is true of ordinary vegetable parenchyma; the originally
spherical cells are ap­prox­i­mate­ly equal in size, but only ap­prox­i­mate­ly;
and there are accordingly all degrees in the regularity and
symmetry of the resulting tissue. But
obviously, wherever we <span class="xxpn" id="p322">{322}</span>
have, in addition to the forces which tend to produce the regular
hexagonal symmetry, some other asymmetrical component arising
from growth or traction, then our regular hexagons will be distorted
in various simple ways. This condition is illustrated in
the accompanying diagram of the epidermis of Girardia; it also
accounts for the more or less pointed or fusiform cells, each still
in contact (as a rule) with six others, which form the epithelial
lining of the blood-vessels: and other similar, or analogous,
instances are very common.</p>

<p>In a soap-froth imprisoned between two glass plates, we have
a symmetrical system of cells, which appear in optical section (as
in Fig. <a href="#fig125" title="go to Fig. 125">125</a>, B) as regular hexagons; but if we press the plates a
little closer together, the hexagons become deformed or flattened
(Fig. <a href="#fig125" title="go to Fig. 125">125</a>, A). In this case, however, if
we cease to apply further pressure, the
tension of the films throughout the
system soon adjusts itself again, and in a
short time the system has regained the
former symmetry of Fig. <a href="#fig125" title="go to Fig. 125">125</a>, B.</p>

<p>In the growth of an ordinary dicotyledonous
leaf, we once more see reflected in
the form of its epidermal cells the tractions,
irregular but on the whole longitudinal,
which growth has superposed on the tensions
of the partition-walls (Fig. <a href="#fig126" title="go to Fig. 126">126</a>). In
the narrow elongated leaf of a Monocotyledon,
such as a hyacinth, the
elongated, apparently quadrangular <span class="xxpn" id="p323">{323}</span>
cells of the epidermis appear as a necessary consequence of the
simpler laws of growth which gave its simple form to the leaf as
a whole. In this last case, however, as in all the others, the rule
still holds that only three partitions (in surface view) meet in a
point; and at their point of meeting the walls are for a short
distance manifestly curved, so as to permit the junction to take
place at or nearly at the normal angle of 120°.</p>

<p>Briefly speaking, wherever we have a system of cylinders or
spheres, associated together with sufficient mutual interaction to
bring them into complete surface contact, there, in section or in
surface view, we tend to get a pattern of hexagons.</p>

<div class="psmprnt3">
<p>While the formation of an hexagonal pattern on the basis
of ready-formed and symmetrically arranged material units
is a very common, and indeed the general way, it does not
follow that there are not others by which such a pattern can
be obtained. For instance, if we take a little triangular
dish of mercury and set it vibrating (either by help of a
tuning-fork, or by simply tapping on the sides) we shall have
a series of little waves or ripples starting inwards from each
of the three faces; and the intercrossing, or interference of
these three sets of waves produces crests and hollows, and
intermediate points of no disturbance, <i>whose loci are seen</i>
as a beautiful pattern of minute hexagons. It is possible
that the very minute and astonishingly regular pattern of
hexagons which we see, for instance, on the surface of many
diatoms, may be a phenomenon of this order<a class="afnanch"
href="#fn363" id="fnanch363">363</a>. The same may be the
case also in Arcella, where an apparently hexagonal pattern
is found not to consist of simple hexagons, but of “straight
lines in three sets of parallels, the lines of each set making
an angle of sixty degrees with those of the other two sets&#xfeff;<a
class="afnanch" href="#fn364" id="fnanch364">364</a>.” We
must also bear in mind, in the case of the minuter forms, the
large possibilities of optical illusion. For instance, in
one of Abbe’s “diffraction-plates,” a pattern of dots, set
at equal interspaces, is reproduced on a very minute scale
by photography; but under certain conditions of microscopic
illumination and focussing, these isolated dots appear as a
pattern of hexagons.</p>

<hr class="hrblksht" />

<p>A symmetrical arrangement of hexagons,
such as we have just been studying, suggests various simple
geometrical corollaries, of which the following may perhaps be
a useful one.</p>

<p>We may sometimes desire to estimate the number of
hexagonal areas or facets in some structure where these
are numerous, such for instance as the <span class="xxpn"
id="p324">{324}</span> cornea of an insect’s eye, or in the
minute pattern of hexagons on many diatoms. An ap­prox­i­mate
enumeration is easily made as follows.</p>

<p>For the area of a hexagon (if we call δ the short
diameter, that namely which bisects two of the opposite
sides) is δ&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup>&#x202f;×&#x202f;(√&#xfeff;3)&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;2, the area
of a circle being <i>d</i>&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup>&#x202f;·&#x202f;π&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;4.
Then, if the diameter (<i>d</i>) of a circular area
include <i>n</i> hexagons, the area of that circle equals
(<i>n</i>&#x202f;·&#x202f;δ)&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup>&#x202f;×&#x202f;π&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;4.
And, dividing this number by the area of a single
hexagon, we obtain for the number of areas in the
circle, each equal to a hexagonal facet, the expression
<i>n</i>&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup>&#x202f;×&#x202f;π&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;4&#x202f;×&#x202f;2&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;√&#xfeff;3
=&#x202f;0·907<i>n</i>&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup>&#x202f;, or
(9&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;10)&#x202f;·&#x202f;<i>n</i>&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup>&#x202f;, nearly.</p>

<p>This calculation deals, not only with the complete facets,
but with the areas of the broken hexagons at the periphery
of the circle. If we neglect these latter, and consider our
whole field as consisting of successive rings of hexagons
about a central one, we may obtain a still simpler rule&#xfeff;<a
class="afnanch" href="#fn365" id="fnanch365">365</a>. For
obviously, around our central hexagon there stands a zone of
six, and around these a zone of twelve, and around these a zone
of eighteen, and so on. And the total number, excluding the
central hexagon, is accordingly:</p>

<p>The same principles which account for the development of
hexagonal symmetry hold true, as a matter of course, not only
of individual <i>cells</i> (in the biological sense), but of any close-packed
bodies of uniform size and originally circular outline;
and the hexagonal pattern is therefore of very common occurrence,
under widely different circumstances. The curious reader may
consult Sir Thomas Browne’s quaint and beautiful account, in the
<i>Garden of Cyrus</i>, of hexagonal (and also of quincuncial) symmetry
in plants and animals, which “doth neatly declare how nature
Geometrizeth, and observeth order in all things.” <span class="xxpn" id="p325">{325}</span></p>

<p>We have many varied examples of this principle among corals,
wherever the polypes are in close juxtaposition, with neither
empty space nor accumulations of matrix between their adjacent
walls. <i>Favosites gothlandica</i>, for instance, furnishes us with an
excellent example. In the great genus Lithostrotion we have some
species that are “massive” and others that are “fasciculate”; in
other words in some the long cylindrical corallites are in close contact
with one another, and in others they are separate and loosely
bundled (Fig. <a href="#fig127" title="go to Fig. 127">127</a>). Accordingly in the former the corallites are</p>

<p class="pcontinue">squeezed into hexagonal prisms, while
in the latter they retain their cylindrical form. Where
the polypes are comparatively few, and so have room to
spread, the mutual pressure ceases to work or only tends to
push them asunder, letting them remain circular in outline
(e.g. Thecosmilia). Where they vary gradually in size, as
for instance in <i>Cyathophyllum hexagonum</i>, they are more
or less hexagonal but are not regular hexagons; and where
there is greater and more irregular variation in size, the
cells will be <i>on the average</i> hexagonal, but some will
have fewer and some more sides than six, as in the annexed
figure of Arachnophyllum (Fig. <a href="#fig129" title="go to Fig. 129">129</a>). <span class="xxpn"
id="p326">{326}</span> Where larger and smaller cells,
cor­re­spon­ding to two different kinds of zooids, are mixed
together, we may get various results. If the larger cells
are numerous enough to be more or less in contact with
one another (e.g. various Monticuliporae) they will be
irregular hexagons, while the smaller cells between them
will be crushed into all manner of irregular angular forms.
If on the other hand the large cells are comparatively few
and are large and strong-walled compared with their smaller
neighbours, then the latter alone will be squeezed into
hexagons, while the larger ones will tend to retain their
circular outline undisturbed (e.g. Heliopora, Heliolites,
etc.).</p>

<p>When, as happens in certain corals, the peripheral walls or
“thecae” of the individual polypes remain undeveloped but
the radiating septa are formed and calcified, then we obtain new
and beautiful math­e­mat­i­cal con­fi­gur­a­tions (Fig. <a href="#fig131" title="go to Fig. 131">131</a>). For the
radiating septa are no longer confined to the circular or hexagonal
bounds of a polypite, but tend to meet and become confluent
with their neighbours on every side; and, tending to assume
positions of equi­lib­rium, or of minimal area, under the restraints
to which they are subject, they fall into congruent curves; and
these correspond, in a striking manner, to the lines of force running,
in a common field of force, between a number of secondary centres.
Similar patterns may be produced in various ways, by the play
of osmotic or magnetic forces; and a particular and very curious
case is to be found in those complicated forms
of nuclear division <span class="xxpn" id="p327">{327}</span>
known as triasters, polyasters, etc., whose relation to a field of
force Hartog has explained<a class="afnanch" href="#fn367" id="fnanch367">367</a>.
It is obvious that, in our corals,
these curving septa are all orthogonal to the non-existent hexagonal
boundaries. As the phenomenon is wholly due to the imperfect
development or non-existence of a thecal wall, it is not surprising
that we find identical con­fi­gur­a­tions among various corals, or
families of corals, not otherwise related to one another; we find
the same or very similar patterns displayed, for instance, in
Synhelia (<i>Oculinidae</i>), in Phillipsastraea (<i>Rugosa</i>), in Thamnastraea
(<i>Fungida</i>), and in many more.</p>

<p>The most famous of all hexagonal conformations and perhaps
the most beautiful is that of the bee’s cell. Here we have, as in</p>

<p class="pcontinue">our last examples, a series of equal cylinders, compressed by
symmetrical forces into regular hexagonal prisms. But in this
case we have two rows of such cylinders, set opposite to one
another, end to end; and we have accordingly to consider also
the conformation of their ends. We may suppose our original
cylindrical cells to have spherical ends, which is their normal and
symmetrical mode of termination; and, for closest packing, it is
obvious that the end of any one cylinder will touch, and fit in
between, the ends of three cylinders in the opposite row. It is
just as when we pile round-shot in a heap;
each sphere that we <span class="xxpn" id="p328">{328}</span>
set down fits into its nest between three others, and the four
form a regular tetrahedral arrangement. Just as it was obvious,
then, that by mutual pressure from the six <i>laterally</i> adjacent cells,
any one cell would be squeezed into a hexagonal prism, so is it also
obvious that, by mutual pressure against the three <i>terminal</i>
neighbours, the end of any one cell will be compressed into a solid
trihedral angle whose edges will meet, as in the analogous case
already described of a system of soap-bubbles, at a plane angle
of 109° and so many minutes and seconds. What we have to
comprehend, then, is how the <i>six</i> sides of the cell are to be combined
with its <i>three</i> terminal facets. This is done by bevelling off three
alternate angles of the prism, in a uniform manner, until we have
tapered the prism to a point; and by so doing, we evidently
produce three <i>rhombic</i> surfaces, each of which is double of the
triangle formed by joining the apex to the three untouched angles
of the prism. If we experiment, not with cylinders, but with
spheres, if for instance we pile together a mass of bread-pills (or
pills of plasticine), and then submit the whole to a uniform pressure,
it is obvious that each ball (like the seeds in a pomegranate, as
Kepler said), will be in contact with <i>twelve</i> others,—six in its own
plane, three below and three above, and in compression it will
therefore develop twelve plane surfaces. It will in short repeat,
above and below, the conditions to which the bee’s cell is subject
at one end only; and, since the sphere is symmetrically situated
towards its neighbours on all sides, it follows that the twelve plane
sides to which its surface has been reduced will be all similar,
equal and similarly situated. Moreover, since we have produced
this result by squeezing our original spheres close together, it is
evident that the bodies so formed completely fill space. The
regular solid which fulfils all these conditions is the <i>rhombic
dodecahedron</i>. The bee’s cell, then, is this figure incompletely
formed: it is a hexagonal prism with one open or unfinished end,
and one trihedral apex of a rhombic dodecahedron.</p>

<p>The geometrical form of the bee’s cell must have attracted the
attention and excited the admiration of mathematicians from time
immemorial. Pappus the Alexandrine has left us (in the introduction
to the Fifth Book of his <i>Collections</i>) an account of its
hexagonal plan, and he drew from its
math­e­mat­i­cal symmetry the <span class="xxpn" id="p329">{329}</span>
conclusion that the bees were endowed with reason: “There
being, then, three figures which of themselves can fill up the
space round a point, viz. the triangle, the square and the hexagon,
the bees have wisely selected for their structure that which contains
most angles, suspecting indeed that it could hold more honey than
either of the other two.” Erasmus Bartholinus was apparently
the first to suggest that this hypothesis was not warranted, and
that the hexagonal form was no more than the necessary result
of equal pressures, each bee striving to make its own little circle
as large as possible.</p>

<p>The in­ves­ti­ga­tion of the ends of the cell was a more difficult
matter, and came later, than that of its sides. In general terms
this arrangement was doubtless often studied and described: as
for instance, in the <i>Garden of Cyrus</i>: “And the Combes themselves
so regularly contrived that their mutual intersections
make three Lozenges at the bottom of every Cell; which severally
regarded make three Rows of neat Rhomboidall Figures, connected
at the angles, and so continue three several chains throughout the
whole comb.” But Maraldi<a class="afnanch" href="#fn368" id="fnanch368">368</a>
(Cassini’s nephew) was the first to
measure the terminal solid angle or determine the form of the
rhombs in the pyramidal ending of the cell. He tells us that the
angles of the rhomb are 110° and 70°: “Chaque base d’alvéole
est formée par trois rhombes presque toujours égaux et semblables,
qui, suivant les mesures que nous avons prises, ont les deux angles
obtus chacun de 110 degrés, et par conséquent les deux aigus
chacun de 70°.” He also stated that the angles of the trapeziums
which form the sides of the body of the cell were identical angles,
of 110° and 70°; but in the same paper he speaks of the angles as
being, respectively, 109°&#x202f;28&#xfeff;′ and 70°&#x202f;32&#xfeff;′. Here a singular confusion
at once arose, and has been perpetuated in the books<a class="afnanch" href="#fn369" id="fnanch369">369</a>.
“Unfortunately Réaumur chose to look upon this second determination
of Maraldi’s as being, as well as the first, a direct result
of measurement, whereas it is in reality theoretical. He speaks of
it as Maraldi’s more precise measurement, and this error has been
repeated in spite of its absurdity to the
present day; nobody <span class="xxpn" id="p330">{330}</span>
appears to have thought of the impossibility of measuring such a
thing as the end of a bee’s cell to the nearest minute.” At any
rate, it now occurred to Réaumur (as curiously enough, it had not
done to Maraldi) that, just as the closely packed hexagons gave
the minimal extent of boundary in a plane, so the actual solid
figure, as determined by Maraldi, might be that which, for a given
solid content, gives the minimum of surface: or which, in other
words, would hold the most honey for the least wax. He set this
problem before Koenig, and the geometer confirmed his conjecture,
the result of his calculations agreeing within two minutes (109°&#x202f;26&#xfeff;′
and 70°&#x202f;34&#xfeff;′) with Maraldi’s determination. But again, Maclaurin<a class="afnanch" href="#fn370" id="fnanch370">370</a>
and Lhuilier<a class="afnanch" href="#fn371" id="fnanch371">371</a>,
by different methods, obtained a result identical
with Maraldi’s; and were able to shew that the discrepancy of
2&#xfeff;′ was due</p>

<p><i>ABCDEF</i>, <i>abcdef</i>, is a right
prism upon a regular hexagonal base.
The corners <i>BDF</i> are cut off by

axis <i>VN</i> of the prism, and intersecting

evident that the volume of the figure
thus formed is the same as that of
the original prism with hexagonal
ends. For, if the axis cut the

<p>That the beautiful regularity of the bee’s architecture is due
to some automatic play of the physical forces, and that it were
fantastic to assume (with Pappus and Réaumur) that the bee
intentionally seeks for a method of economising wax, is certain,
but the precise manner of this automatic action is not so clear.
When the hive-bee builds a solitary cell, or a small cluster of cells,
as it does for those eggs which are to develop into queens, it makes
but a rude production. The queen-cells are lumps of coarse wax
hollowed out and roughly bitten into shape, bearing the marks of
the bee’s jaws, like the marks of a blunt adze on a rough-hewn log.
Omitting the simplest of all cases, when (as among some humble-bees)
the old cocoons are used to hold honey, the cells built by
the “solitary” wasps and bees are of various kinds. They may
be formed by partitioning off little chambers in
a hollow stem; <span class="xxpn" id="p332">{332}</span>
they may be rounded or oval capsules, often very neatly constructed,
out of mud, or vegetable <i>fibre</i> or little stones, agglutinated
together with a salivary glue; but they shew, except for their
rounded or tubular form, no math­e­mat­i­cal symmetry. The social
wasps and many bees build, usually out of vegetable matter
chewed into a paste with saliva, very beautiful nests of “combs”;
and the close-set papery cells which constitute these combs are
just as regularly hexagonal as are the waxen cells of the hive-bee.
But in these cases (or nearly all of them) the cells are in a single
row; their sides are regularly hexagonal, but their ends, from the
want of opponent forces, remain simply spherical. In <i>Melipona
domestica</i> (of which Darwin epitomises Pierre Huber’s description)
“the large waxen honey-cells are nearly spherical, nearly equal in
size, and are aggregated into an irregular mass.” But the spherical
form is only seen on the outside of the mass; for inwardly each
cell is flattened into “two, three or more flat surfaces, according
as the cell adjoins two, three or more other cells. When one cell
rests on three other cells, which from the spheres being nearly
of the same size is very frequently and necessarily the case, the
three flat surfaces are united into a pyramid; and this pyramid, as
Huber has remarked, is manifestly a gross imitation of the three-sided
pyramidal base of the cell of the hive-bee<a class="afnanch" href="#fn373" id="fnanch373">373</a>.”
The question
is, to what particular force are we to ascribe the plane surfaces
and definite angles which define the sides of the cell in all these
cases, and the ends of the cell in cases where one row meets and
opposes another. We have seen that Bartholin suggested, and it
is still commonly believed, that this result is due to simple physical
pressure, each bee enlarging as much as it can the cell which it
is a-building, and nudging its wall outwards till it fills every
intervening gap and presses hard against the similar efforts of
its neighbour in the cell next door<a class="afnanch" href="#fn374" id="fnanch374">374</a>.
But it
is very doubtful <span class="xxpn" id="p333">{333}</span>
whether such physical or mechanical pressure, more or less intermittently
exercised, could produce the all but perfectly smooth,
plane surfaces and the all but perfectly definite and constant
angles which characterise the cell, whether it be constructed of
wax or papery pulp. It seems more likely that we have to do
with a true surface-tension effect; in other words, that the walls
assume their configuration when in a semi-fluid state, while the
papery pulp is still liquid, or while the wax is warm under the
high temperature of the crowded hive<a class="afnanch" href="#fn375" id="fnanch375">375</a>.
Under these circumstances,
the direct efforts of the wasp or bee may be supposed
to be limited to the making of a tubular cell, as thin as the nature
of the material permits, and packing these little cells as close as
possible together. It is then easily conceivable that the symmetrical
tensions of the adjacent films (though somewhat retarded
by viscosity) should suffice to bring the whole system into equi­lib­rium,
that is to say into the precise configuration which the
comb actually presents. In short, the Maraldi pyramids which
terminate the bee’s cell are precisely identical with the facets of
a rhombic dodecahedron, such as we have assumed to constitute
(and which doubtless under certain conditions do constitute) the
surfaces of contact in the interior of a mass of soap-bubbles or
of uniform parenchymatous cells; and there is every reason to
believe that the physical explanation is identical, and not merely
math­e­mat­i­cally analogous.</p>

<p>The remarkable passage in which Buffon discusses the bee’s
cell and the hexagonal configuration in general is of such historical
importance, and tallies so closely with the whole trend of our
enquiry, that I will quote it in full: “Dirai-je encore un mot;
ces cellules des abeilles, tant vantées, tant admirées, me fournissent
une preuve de plus contre l’enthousiasme et l’admiration; cette
figure, toute géométrique et toute régulière qu’elle nous paraît, et
qu’elle est en effet dans la spéculation, n’est ici qu’un résultat
mécanique et assez imparfait qui se trouve
souvent dans la nature, <span class="xxpn" id="p334">{334}</span>
et que l’on remarque même dans les productions les plus brutes;
les cristaux et plusieurs autres pierres, quelques sels, etc., prennent
constamment cette figure dans leur formation. Qu’on observe les
petites écailles de la peau d’une roussette, on verra qu’elles sont
hexagones, parce que chaque écaille croissant en même temps se
fait obstacle, et tend à occuper le plus d’espace qu’il est possible
dans un espace donné: on voit ces mêmes hexagones dans le
second estomac des animaux ruminans, on les trouve dans les
graines, dans leurs capsules, dans certaines fleurs, etc. Qu’on
remplisse un vaisseau de pois, ou plûtot de quelque autre graine
cylindrique, et qu’on le ferme exactement après y avoir versé
autant d’eau que les intervalles qui restent entre ces graines
peuvent en recevoir; qu’on fasse bouillir cette eau, tous ces
cylindres deviendront de colonnes à six pans<a class="afnanch" href="#fn376" id="fnanch376">376</a>.
On y voit clairement
la raison, qui est purement mécanique; chaque graine, dont
la figure est cylindrique, tend par son renflement à occuper le
plus d’espace possible dans un espace donné, elles deviennent donc
toutes nécessairement hexagones par la compression réciproque.
Chaque abeille cherche à occuper de même le plus d’espace possible
dans un espace donné, il est donc nécessaire aussi, puisque le
corps des abeilles est cylindrique, que leurs cellules sont hexagones,—par
la même raison des obstacles réciproques. On donne plus
d’esprit aux mouches dont les ouvrages sont les plus réguliers;
les abeilles sont, dit-on, plus ingénieuses que les guêpes, que les
frélons, etc., qui savent aussi l’architecture, mais dont les constructions
sont plus grossières et plus irrégulières que celles des
abeilles: on ne veut pas voir, ou l’on ne se doute pas que cette
régularité, plus ou moins grande, dépend uniquement du nombre
et de la figure, et nullement de l’intelligence de ces petites bêtes;
plus elles sont nombreuses, plus il y a des forces qui agissent
également et s’opposent de même, plus il y a par conséquent de
contrainte mécanique, de régularité forcée, et de perfection
apparente dans leurs productions<a class="afnanch" href="#fn377" id="fnanch377">377</a>.”

<p>A very beautiful hexagonal symmetry, as seen in section, or
dodecahedral, as viewed in the solid, is presented by the cells
which form the pith of certain rushes (e.g. <i>Juncus effusus</i>), and
somewhat less dia­gram­ma­ti­cally by those which make the pith
of the banana. These cells are stellate in form, and the tissue
presents in section the appearance of a network of six-rayed
stars (Fig. <a href="#fig133" title="go to Fig. 133">133</a>, <i>c</i>), linked together by the tips of the rays, and
separated by symmetrical, air-filled, intercellular spaces. In thick
sections, the solid twelve-rayed stars may be very beautifully seen
under the binocular microscope.</p>

 <div class="pcaption">Fig. 133. Diagram of development of “stellate cells,” in
 pith of <i>Juncus</i>. (The dark, or shaded, areas represent
 the cells; the light areas being the gradually enlarging
 “intercellular spaces.”)</div></div>

<p>What has happened here is not difficult to understand.
Imagine, as before, a system of equal spheres all in contact, each
one therefore touching six others in an equatorial plane; and let
the cells be not only in contact, but become attached at the points
of contact. Then instead of each cell expanding, so as to encroach
on and fill up the intercellular spaces, let each cell tend to contract
or shrivel up, by the withdrawal of fluid from
its interior. The <span class="xxpn" id="p336">{336}</span>
result will obviously be that the intercellular spaces will increase;
the six equatorial attachments of each cell (Fig. <a href="#fig133" title="go to Fig. 133">133</a>, <i>a</i>) (or its twelve
attachments in all, to adjacent cells) will remain fixed, and the
portions of cell-wall between these points of attachment will be
withdrawn in a symmetrical fashion (<i>b</i>) towards the centre. As
the final result (<i>c</i>) we shall have a “dodecahedral star” or star-polygon,
which appears in section as a six-rayed figure. It is
obviously necessary that the pith-cells should not only be attached
to one another, but that the outermost layer should be firmly
attached to a boundary wall, so as to preserve the symmetry of
the system. What actually occurs in the rush is tantamount to
this, but not absolutely identical. Here it is not so much the
pith-cells which tend to shrivel within a boundary of constant
size, but rather the boundary wall (that is, the peripheral ring of
woody and other tissues) which continues to expand after the
pith-cells which it encloses have ceased to grow or to multiply.
The twelve points of attachment on the spherical surface of each
little pith-cell are uniformly drawn asunder; but the content, or
volume, of the cell does not increase correspondingly; and the
remaining portions of the surface, accordingly, shrink inwards and
gradually constitute the complicated surface of a twelve-pointed
star, which is still a symmetrical figure and is still also a surface
of minimal area under the new conditions.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>A few years after the publication of Plateau’s book, Lord
Kelvin shewed, in a short but very beautiful paper<a class="afnanch" href="#fn378" id="fnanch378">378</a>,
that we must
not hastily assume from such arguments as the foregoing, that
a close-packed assemblage of rhombic dodecahedra will be the true
and general solution of the problem of dividing space with a
minimum partitional area, or will be present in a cellular liquid
“foam,” in which it is manifest that the problem is actually and
automatically solved. The general math­e­mat­i­cal solution of the
problem (as we have already indicated) is, that every interface or
partition-wall must have constant curvature throughout; that
where such partitions meet in an edge, they must intersect at
angles such that equal forces, in planes
perpendicular to the line <span class="xxpn" id="p337">{337}</span>
of intersection, shall balance; and finally, that no more than three
such interfaces may meet in a line or edge, whence it follows that
the angle of intersection of the film-surfaces must be exactly 120°.
An assemblage of equal and similar rhombic dodecahedra goes far
to meet the case: it completely fills up space; all its surfaces or
interfaces are planes, that is to say, surfaces of constant curvature
throughout; and these surfaces all meet together at angles of 120°.
Nevertheless, the proof that our rhombic dodecahedron (such as
we find exemplified in the bee’s cell) is a surface of minimal area,
is not a comprehensive proof; it is limited to certain conditions,
and practically amounts to no more than this, that of the regular

for its solid content.</p>

<p>The rhombic dodecahedron has six tetrahedral angles, and
eight trihedral angles; and it is obvious, on consideration, that
at each of the former six dodecahedra meet in a point, and that,
where the four tetrahedral facets of each coalesce with their
neighbours, we have twelve plane films, or interfaces, meeting in
a point. In a precisely similar fashion, we may imagine twelve
plane films, drawn inwards from the twelve edges of a cube, to
meet at a point in the centre of the cube. But, as Plateau
discovered<a class="afnanch" href="#fn379" id="fnanch379">379</a>,
when we dip a cubical
wire skeleton into soap-solution and
take it out again, the twelve films
which are thus generated do <i>not</i>
meet in a point, but are grouped
around a small central, plane, quadrilateral
film (Fig. <a href="#fig134" title="go to Fig. 134">134</a>). In other
words, twelve plane films, meeting in
a point, are <i>essentially unstable</i>. If
we blow upon our artificial film-system,
the little quadrilateral alters
its place, setting itself parallel now to one and now to another of
the paired faces of the cube; but we never get rid of it. Moreover,
the size and shape of the quadrilateral, as of all the other films in the
system, are perfectly definite. Of the twelve
films (which we had <span class="xxpn" id="p338">{338}</span>
expected to find all plane and all similar) four are plane isosceles
triangles, and eight are slightly curved quadrilateral figures. The
former have two curved sides, meeting at an angle of 109°&#x202f;28&#xfeff;′,
and their apices coincide with the corners of the central quadrilateral,
whose sides are also curved, and also meet at this identical
angle;—which (as we observe) is likewise an angle which we have
been dealing with in the simpler case of the bee’s cell, and indeed
in all the regular solids of which we have yet treated.</p>

<p>By completing the assemblage of polyhedra of which
Plateau’s skeleton-cube gives a part, Lord Kelvin
shewed that we should obtain a set of equal and similar
fourteen-sided figures, or “tetrakaidecahedra”; and that
by means of an assemblage of these figures space is
homogeneously partitioned—that is to say, into equal,
similar and similarly situated cells—with an economy
of surface in relation to area even greater than in an
assemblage of rhombic dodecahedra.</p>

<p>In the most generalised case, the tetrakaidecahedron is bounded
by three pairs of equal and parallel quadrilateral faces, and four
pairs of equal and parallel hexagonal faces, neither the quadrilaterals
nor the hexagons being necessarily plane. In a certain
particular case, the quadrilaterals are plane surfaces, but the
hexagons slightly curved “anticlastic” surfaces; and these latter
have at every point equal and opposite curvatures, and are
surfaces of minimal curvature for a boundary of six curved edges.
The figure has the remarkable property that, like the plane
rhombic dodecahedron, it so partitions space that three faces
meeting in an edge do so everywhere at equal angles of 120°&#x202f;<a class="afnanch" href="#fn380" id="fnanch380">380</a>.</p>

<p>We may take it as certain that, in a system of <i>perfectly</i> fluid
films, like the interior of a mass of soap-bubbles, where the films
are perfectly free to glide or to rotate over one another, the mass
is actually divided into cells of this
remarkable conformation. <span class="xxpn" id="p339">{339}</span>
And it is quite possible, also, that in the cells of a vegetable
parenchyma, by carefully macerating them apart, the same conformation
may yet be demonstrated under suitable conditions;
that is to say when the whole tissue is highly symmetrical, and the
individual cells are as nearly as possible equal in size. But in an
ordinary microscopic <i>section</i>, it would seem practically impossible
to distinguish the fourteen-sided figure from the twelve-sided.
Moreover, if we have anything whatsoever interposed so as to
prevent our twelve films meeting in a point, and (so to speak) to
take the place of our little central quadrilateral,—if we have, for
instance, a tiny bead or droplet in the centre of our artificial
system, or even a little thickening, or “bourrelet” as Plateau called
it, of the cell-wall, then it is no longer necessary that the
tetrakaidecahedron should be formed. Accordingly, it is very
probably the case that, in the parenchymatous tissue, under the
actual conditions of restraint and of very imperfect fluidity, it is
after all the rhombic dodecahedral configuration which, even under
perfectly symmetrical conditions, is generally assumed.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>It follows from all that we have said, that the problems
connected with the conformation of cells, and with the manner in
which a given space is partitioned by them, soon become exceedingly
complex. And while this is so even when all our cells are equal
and symmetrically placed, it becomes vastly more so when cells
varying even slightly in size, in hardness, rigidity or other qualities,
are packed together. The mathematics of the case very soon
become too hard for us; but in its essence, the phenomenon
remains the same. We have little reason to doubt, and no just
cause to disbelieve, that the whole configuration, for instance of
an egg in the advanced stages of segmentation, is accurately
determined by simple physical laws, just as much as in the early
stages of two or four cells, during which early stages we are able to
recognise and demonstrate the forces and their resultant effects.
But when math­e­mat­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tion has become too difficult, it
often happens that physical experiment can reproduce for us the
phenomena which Nature exhibits to us, and which we are striving
to comprehend. For instance, in an admirable research, M. Robert
shewed, some years ago, not only that the
early segmentation of <span class="xxpn" id="p340">{340}</span>
the egg of <i>Trochus</i> (a marine univalve mollusc) proceeded in
accordance with the laws of surface tension, but he also succeeded
in imitating by means of soap-bubbles, several stages, one after
another, of the developing egg.</p>

 <div class="pcaption">Fig. 135. Aggregations of four soap-bubbles, to shew
 various arrangements of the intermediate partition and
 polar furrows. (After Robert.)</div></div>

<p>M. Robert carried his experiments as far as the stage of
sixteen cells, or bubbles. It is not easy to carry the artificial
system quite so far, but in the earlier stages the experiment is
easy; we have merely to blow our bubbles in a little dish, adding
one to another, and adjusting their sizes to produce a symmetrical
system. One of the simplest and prettiest parts of his in­ves­ti­ga­tion
concerned the “polar furrow” of which we have spoken on p. <a href="#p310" title="go to pg. 310">310</a>.
On blowing four little contiguous bubbles he found (as we may
all find with the greatest ease) that they form a symmetrical system,
two in contact with one another by a laminar film, and two,
which are elevated a little above the others, and which are separated
by the length of the aforesaid lamina. The bubbles are thus in
contact three by three, their partition-walls making with one
another equal angles of 120°. The upper and lower edges of the
intermediate lamina (the lower one visible through the transparent
system) constitute the two polar furrows of the embryologist
(Fig. <a href="#fig135" title="go to Fig. 135">135</a>, 1–3). The lamina itself is plane when the system is
symmetrical, but it responds by a cor­re­spon­ding curvature to
the least inequality of the bubbles on either side. In the
experiment, the upper polar furrow is usually a little shorter
than the lower, but parallel to it; that is to say, the lamina
is of trapezoidal form: this lack of perfect symmetry being
due (in the experimental case) to the lower portion of the
bubbles being somewhat drawn asunder by the tension of their
attachments to the sides of the dish (Fig. <a href="#fig135" title="go to Fig. 135">135</a>, 4). A similar
phenomenon is usually found in Trochus, according to Robert,
and many other observers have likewise found the upper furrow
to be shorter than the one below. In the various species of the
genus Crepidula, Conklin asserts that the two furrows are equal
in <i>C. convexa</i>, that the upper one is the shorter in <i>C. fornicata</i>,
and that the upper one all but disappears in <i>C. plana</i>; but we may
well be permitted to doubt, without the evidence of very special
investigations, whether these slight physical differences are
actually char­ac­ter­is­tic of, and constant in,
particular allied <i>species</i>. <span class="xxpn" id="p341">{341}</span>
Returning to the experimental case, Robert found that by withdrawing
a little air from, and so diminishing the bulk of the two
terminal bubbles (i.e. those at the ends of the intermediate lamina),
the upper polar furrow was caused to elongate, till it became equal
in length to the lower; and by continuing the process it became
the longer in its turn. These two conditions have again been
described by investigators as char­ac­ter­is­tic of this embryo or that;
for instance in Unio, Lillie has described the two furrows as
gradually altering their respective lengths<a class="afnanch" href="#fn381" id="fnanch381">381</a>;
and Wilson (as Lillie
remarks) had already pointed out that “the reduction of the
apical cross-furrow, as compared with that at
the vegetative pole <span class="xxpn" id="p342">{342}</span>
in molluscs and annelids ‘stands in obvious relation to the different
size of the cells produced at the two poles<a class="afnanch" href="#fn382" id="fnanch382">382</a>.’&#x200a;”</p>

<p>When the two lateral bubbles are gradually reduced in size,
or the two terminal ones enlarged, the upper furrow becomes
shorter and shorter; and at the moment when it is about to
vanish, a new furrow makes its instantaneous appearance in a
direction perpendicular to the old one; but the inferior furrow,
constrained by its attachment to the base, remains unchanged,
and accordingly our two polar furrows, which were formerly
parallel, are now at right angles to one another. Instead of a
single plane quadrilateral partition, we have now two triangular
ones, meeting in the middle of the system by their apices, and
lying in planes at right angles to one another (Fig. <a href="#fig135" title="go to Fig. 135">135</a>, 5–7)<a class="afnanch" href="#fn383" id="fnanch383">383</a>.
Two such polar furrows, equal in length and arranged in a cross,
have again been frequently described by the embryologists.
Robert himself found this condition in Trochus, as an occasional
or exceptional occurrence: it has been described as normal in
Asterina by Ludwig, in Branchipus by Spangenberg, and in
Podocoryne and Hydractinia by Bunting. It is evident that it
represents a state of unstable equi­lib­rium, only to be maintained
under certain conditions of restraint within the system.</p>

<p>So, by slight and delicate modifications in the relative size of
the cells, we may pass through all the possible arrangements of the
median partition, and of the “furrows” which correspond to its
upper and lower edges; and every one of these arrangements has
been frequently observed in the four-celled stage of various embryos.
As the phases pass one into the other, they are accompanied by
changes in the curvature of the partition, which in like manner
correspond precisely to phenomena which the embryologists have
witnessed and described. And all these con­fi­gur­a­tions belong to
that large class of phenomena whose distribution among embryos,
or among organisms in general, bears no relation to the boundaries
of zoological clas­si­fi­ca­tion; through
molluscs, worms, <span class="xxpn" id="p343">{343}</span>
coelenterates, vertebrates and what not, we meet with now one and now
another, in a medley which defies clas­si­fi­ca­tion. They are not
“vital phenomena,” or “functions” of the organism, or special
char­ac­teris­tics of this or that organism, but purely physical
phenomena. The kindred but more complicated phenomena
which correspond to the polar furrow when a larger number of
cells than four are associated together, we shall deal with in the
next chapter.</p>

<p>Having shewn that the capillary phenomena are patent and
unmistakable during the earlier stages of embryonic development,
but soon become more obscure and incapable of experimental
reproduction in the later stages, when the cells have increased in
number, various writers including Robert himself have been
inclined to argue that the physical phenomena die away, and are
overpowered and cancelled by agencies of a very different order.
Here we pass into a region where direct observation and experiment
are not at hand to guide us, and where a man’s trend of
thought, and way of judging the whole evidence in the case, must
shape his philosophy. We must remember that, even in a froth
of soap-bubbles, we can apply an exact analysis only to the simplest
cases and conditions of the phenomenon; we cannot describe,
but can only imagine, the forces which in such a froth control the
respective sizes, positions and curvatures of the innumerable
bubbles and films of which it consists; but our knowledge is
enough to leave us assured that what we have learned by in­ves­ti­ga­tion
of the simplest cases includes the principles which
determine the most complex. In the case of the growing embryo
we know from the beginning that surface tension is only one of
the physical forces at work; and that other forces, including
those displayed within the interior of each living cell, play their
part in the determination of the system. But we have no evidence
whatsoever that at this point, or that point, or at any, the dominion
of the physical forces over the material system gives place to a
new condition where agencies at present unknown to the physicist
impose themselves on the living matter, and become responsible
for the conformation of its material fabric.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Before we leave for the present the subject
of the segmenting <span class="xxpn" id="p344">{344}</span>
egg, we must take brief note of two associated problems: viz.
(1) the formation and enlargement of the segmentation cavity, or
central interspace around which the cells tend to group themselves
in a single layer, and (2) the formation of the gastrula, that is to
say (in a typical case) the conversion “by invagination,” of the
one-layered ball into a two-layered cup. Neither problem is free
from difficulty, and all we can do meanwhile is to state them in
general terms, introducing some more or less plausible assumptions.</p>

<p>The former problem is comparatively easy, as regards the
tendency of a segmentation cavity to <i>enlarge</i>, when once it has
been established. We may then assume that subdivision of the
cells is due to the appearance of a new-formed septum within each
cell, that this septum has a tendency to shrink under surface
tension, and that these changes will be accompanied on the whole
by a diminution of surface energy in the system. This being so,
it may be shewn that the volume of the divided cells must be less
than it was prior to division, or in other words that part of their
contents must exude during the process of segmentation<a class="afnanch" href="#fn384" id="fnanch384">384</a>.
Accordingly, the case where the segmentation cavity enlarges and
the embryo developes into a hollow blastosphere may, under the
circumstances, be simply described as the case where that outflow
or exudation from the cells of the blastoderm is directed on the
whole inwards.</p>

<p>The physical forces involved in the invagination of the cell-layer
to form the gastrula have been repeatedly discussed<a class="afnanch" href="#fn385" id="fnanch385">385</a>,
but
the true explanation seems as yet to be by no means clear. The
case, however, is probably not a very difficult one, provided that
we may assume a difference of osmotic pressure at the two poles
of the blastosphere, that is to say between the cells which are
being differentiated into outer and inner, into epiblast and hypoblast.
It is plain that a blastosphere, or hollow vesicle bounded
by a layer of vesicles, is under very different physical conditions
from a single, simple vesicle or bubble. The blastosphere has no
effective surface tension of its own, such as to
exert pressure on <span class="xxpn" id="p345">{345}</span>
its contents or bring the whole into a spherical form; nor will local
variations of surface energy be directly capable of affecting the
form of the system. But if the substance of our blastosphere be
sufficiently viscous, then osmotic forces may set up currents
which, reacting on the external fluid pressure, may easily cause
modifications of shape; and the particular case of invagination
itself will not be difficult to account for on this assumption of
non-uniform
exudation and imbibition.</p>

or Cell-aggregates (continued)">CHAPTER VIII
<span class="h2ttl">
THE FORMS OF TISSUES OR CELL-AGGREGATES (<i>continued</i>)</span></h2></div>

<p>The problems which we have been considering, and especially
that of the bee’s cell, belong to a class of “isoperimetrical”
problems, which deal with figures whose surface is a minimum for
a definite content or volume. Such problems soon become
difficult, but we may find many easy examples which lead us
towards the explanation of biological phenomena; and the
particular subject which we shall find most easy of approach is
that of the division, in definite proportions, of some definite
portion of space, by a partition-wall of minimal area. The
theoretical principles so arrived at we shall then attempt to apply,
after the manner of Berthold and Errera, to the actual biological
phenomena of cell-division.</p>

<p>This in­ves­ti­ga­tion we may approach in two ways: by considering,
namely, the partitioning off from some given space or
area of one-half (or some other fraction) of its content; or again,
by dealing simultaneously with the partitions necessary for the
breaking up of a given space into a definite number of compartments.</p>

<p>If we take, to begin with, the simple case of a cubical cell, it
is obvious that, to divide it into two halves, the smallest possible
partition-wall is one which runs parallel to, and midway between,
two of its opposite sides. If we call <i>a</i> the length of one of the
edges of the cube, then <i>a</i>&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup> is the area, alike of one of its sides, and
of the partition which we have interposed parallel, or normal,
thereto. But if we now consider the bisected cube, and wish to
divide the one-half of it again, it is obvious that another partition
parallel to the first, so far from being the smallest possible, is
precisely twice the size of a cross-partition
perpendicular to it; <span class="xxpn" id="p347">{347}</span>
for the area of this new partition is <i>a</i>&#x202f;×&#x202f;<i>a</i>&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;2. And again, for a
third bisection, our next partition must be perpendicular to the
other two, and it is obviously a little square, with an area of
(½&#x202f;<i>a</i>)&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup>
=&#x202f;¼&#x202f;<i>a</i>&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup>&#x202f;.</p>

<p>From this we may draw the simple rule that, for a rectangular
body or parallelopiped to be divided equally by means of a
partition of minimal area, (1) the partition must cut across the
longest axis of the figure; and (2) in the event of successive
bisections, each partition must run at right angles to its immediate
predecessor.</p>

<div class="dctr04" id="fig136">
<img src="images/i347.png" width="496" height="509" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 136. (After Berthold.)</div></div>

<p>We have already spoken of “Sachs’s Rules,” which are an
empirical statement of the method of cell-division in plant-tissues;
and we may now set them forth in full.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(1) The cell typically tends to divide into two co-equal parts.</p></li>

<li><p>(2) Each new plane of division tends to intersect at right
angles the preceding plane of division.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The first of these rules is a statement of
physiological fact, not without its exceptions, but so
generally true that it will justify us in limiting our
enquiry, for the most part, to cases of equal subdivision.
That it is by no means universally true for cells
generally is shewn, for instance, by such well-known
cases <span class="xxpn" id="p348">{348}</span> as the
unequal segmentation of the frog’s egg. It is true when
the dividing cell is homogeneous, and under the influence
of symmetrical forces; but it ceases to be true when the
field is no longer dynamically symmetrical, for instance,
when the parts differ in surface tension or internal
pressure. This latter condition, of asymmetry of field, is
frequent in segmenting eggs<a class="afnanch" href="#fn386"
id="fnanch386">386</a>, and is then equivalent to the
principle upon which Balfour laid stress, as leading to
“unequal” or to “partial” segmentation of the egg,—viz. the
unequal or asymmetrical distribution of protoplasm and of
food-yolk.</p>

<p>The second rule, which also has its exceptions, is true in a
large number of cases; and it owes its validity, as we may judge
from the illustration of the repeatedly bisected cube, solely to the
guiding principle of minimal areas. It is in short subordinate
to, and covers certain cases included under, a much more important
and fundamental rule, due not to Sachs but to Errera; that (3) the
incipient partition-wall of a dividing cell tends to be such that its
area is the least possible by which the given space-content can be
enclosed.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Let us return to the case of our cube, and let us suppose that,
instead of bisecting it, we desire to shut off some small portion
only of its volume. It is found in the course of experiments upon
soap-films, that if we try to bring a partition-film too near to one
side of a cubical (or rectangular) space, it becomes unstable; and
is easily shifted to a totally new position, in which it constitutes
a curved cylindrical wall, cutting off one corner of the cube.
It meets the sides of the cube at right angles (for reasons which we
have already considered); and, as we may see
from the symmetry <span class="xxpn" id="p349">{349}</span>
of the case, it constitutes precisely one-quarter of a cylinder.
Our plane transverse partition, wherever it was placed, had always
the same area, viz. <i>a</i>&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup>&#x202f;; and it is obvious that a cylindrical wall,
if it cut off a small corner, may be much less than this. We want,
accordingly, to determine what is the particular volume which
might be partitioned off with equal economy of wall-space in one
way as the other, that is to say, what area of cylindrical wall
would be neither more nor less than the area <i>a</i>&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup>&#x202f;. The calculation
is very easy.</p>

<p>The <i>surface-area</i> of a cylinder of length <i>a</i> is
2π<i>r</i>&#x202f;·&#x202f;<i>a</i>, and that of our quarter-cylinder
is, therefore, <i>a</i>&#x202f;·&#x202f;π<i>r</i>&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;2; and this being,
by hypothesis,
=&#x202f;<i>a</i>&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup>&#x202f;, we have <i>a</i>
=&#x202f;π<i>r</i>&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;2, or <i>r</i>
=&#x202f;2<i>a</i>&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;π.</p>

<p>The <i>volume</i> of a cylinder, of length <i>a</i>, is
<i>a</i>π<i>r</i>&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup>&#x202f;, and that of our quarter-cylinder
is <i>a</i>&#x202f;·&#x202f;π<i>r</i>&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup>&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;4, which
(by substituting the value of <i>r</i>) is equal to
<i>a</i>&#xfeff;<sup>3</sup>&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;π.</p>

<p>Now precisely this same volume is, obviously, shut off by a
transverse partition of area <i>a</i>&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup>&#x202f;, if the third side
of the rectangular space be equal to <i>a</i>&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;π. And this fraction,
if we take <i>a</i>
=&#x202f;1, is equal to 0·318..., or rather
less than one-third. And, as we have just seen, the radius,
or side, of the cor­re­spon­ding quarter-cylinder will be twice
that fraction, or equal to ·636 times the side of the cubical
cell.</p>

<div class="dright dwth-e" id="fig137">
<img src="images/i349.png" width="327" height="324" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 137.</div></div>

<p>If then, in the process of division of a cubical
cell, it so divide that the two portions be not equal in
volume but that one portion by anything less than about
three-tenths of the whole, or three-sevenths of the other
portion, there will be a tendency for the cell to divide,
not by means of a plane transverse partition, but by means
of a curved, cylindrical wall cutting off one corner of the
original cell; and the part so cut off will be one-quarter
of a cylinder. <br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<p>By a similar calculation we can shew that a <i>spherical</i>
wall, cutting off one solid angle of the cube, and
constituting an octant of a sphere, would likewise be of
less area than a plane partition as soon as the volume to
be enclosed was not greater than about <span class="xxpn"
id="p350">{350}</span> one-quarter of the original cell&#xfeff;<a
class="afnanch" href="#fn387" id="fnanch387">387</a>. But
while both the cylindrical wall and the spherical wall
would be of less area than the plane transverse partition
after that limit (of one-quarter volume) was passed, the
cylindrical would still be the better of the two up to a
further limit. It is only when the volume to be partitioned
off <span class="xxpn" id="p351">{351}</span> is no greater
than about 0·15, or somewhere about one-seventh, of the
whole, that the spherical cell-wall in an angle of the
cubical cell, that is to say the octant of a sphere, is
definitely of less area than the quarter-cylinder. In the
accompanying diagram (Fig. <a href="#fig138" title="go to Fig. 138">138</a>) the relative areas of the
three partitions are shewn for all fractions, less than
one-half, of the divided cell.</p>

<div class="psmprnt3">

<div class="dctr04" id="fig138">
<img src="images/i350.png" width="563" height="844" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 138.</div></div>

<p>In this figure, we see that the plane transverse partition, whatever fraction
of the cube it cut off, is always of the same dimensions, that is to say is
always equal to <i>a</i>&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup>&#x202f;, or
=&#x202f;1. If one-half of the cube have to be cut off, this
plane transverse partition is much the best, for we see by the diagram that a
cylindrical partition cutting off an equal volume would have an area about
25%, and a spherical partition would have an area about 50% greater.
The point <i>A</i> in the diagram corresponds to the point where the cylindrical
partition would begin to have an advantage over the plane, that is to say
(as we have seen) when the fraction to be cut off is about one-third, or ·318
of the whole. In like manner, at <i>B</i> the spherical octant begins to have an

<p>The case we have dealt with is of little practical
importance to the biologist, because the cases in which
a cubical, or rectangular, cell divides unequally, and
unsymmetrically, are apparently few; but we can find, as
Berthold pointed out, a few examples, for instance in the
hairs within the reproductive “conceptacles” of certain
Fuci (Sphacelaria, etc., Fig. <a href="#fig139" title="go to Fig. 139">139</a>), or in the “paraphyses”
of mosses (Fig. <a href="#fig142" title="go to Fig. 142">142</a>). But it is of great theoretical
importance: as serving to introduce us to a large class
of cases, in which the shape and the relative dimensions
of the original cavity lead, according to the principle
of minimal areas, to cell-division in very definite and
sometimes unexpected ways. It is not easy, nor indeed
possible, to give a generalised account of these cases,
for the limiting conditions are somewhat complex, and
the math­e­mat­i­cal treatment soon becomes difficult. But
it is easy to comprehend a few simple cases, which of
themselves will carry us a good long way; and which will
go far to convince the student that, in other cases <span
class="xxpn" id="p352">{352}</span> which we cannot fully
master, the same guiding principle is at the root of the
matter. <br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<p>The bisection of a solid (or the subdivision of its volume in
other definite proportions) soon leads us into a geometry which,
if not necessarily difficult, is apt to be unfamiliar; but in such
problems we can go a long way, and often far enough for our
particular purpose, if we merely consider the plane geometry of
a side or section of our figure. For instance, in the case of the
cube which we have been just considering, and in the case of the
plane and cylindrical partitions by which it has been divided, it
is obvious that, since these two partitions extend symmetrically
from top to bottom of our cube, that we need only consider (so
far as they are concerned) the manner in which they subdivide
the <i>base</i> of the cube. The whole problem of the solid, up to a
certain point, is contained in our plane diagram of Fig. <a href="#fig138" title="go to Fig. 138">138</a>. And
when our particular solid is a solid of revolution, then it is obvious
that a study of its plane of symmetry (that is to say any plane
passing through its axis of rotation) gives us the solution of the
whole problem. The right cone is a case in point, for here the
in­ves­ti­ga­tion of its modes of symmetrical subdivision is completely
met by an examination of the isosceles triangle which constitutes
its plane of symmetry.</p>

<p>The bisection of an isosceles triangle by a line which
shall be the shortest possible is a very easy problem. Let
<i>ABC</i> be such a triangle of which <i>A</i> is the apex; it may be
shewn that, for its shortest line of bisection, we are limited
to three cases: viz. to a vertical line <i>AD</i>, bisecting the
angle at <i>A</i> and the side <i>BC</i>; to a transverse line parallel
to the base <i>BC</i>; or to an oblique line parallel to <i>AB</i> or
to <i>AC</i>. The respective magnitudes, or lengths, of these
partition lines follow at once from the magnitudes of the
angles of our triangle. For we know, to begin with, since the
areas of similar figures vary as the squares of their linear
dimensions, that, in order to bisect the area, a line parallel
to one side of our triangle must always have a length equal
to 1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;√&#xfeff;2 of that side. If then, we take
our base, <i>BC</i>, in all cases of a length
=&#x202f;2, the
transverse partition drawn parallel to it will always have a
length equal to 2&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;√&#xfeff;2, or
=&#x202f;√&#xfeff;2.
The vertical <span class="xxpn" id="p353">{353}</span>
partition, <i>AD</i>, since <i>BD</i>
=&#x202f;1, will always equal
tan&#x202f;β (β being the angle <i>ABC</i>). And the oblique
partition, <i>GH</i>, being equal to <i>AB</i>&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;√&#xfeff;2
=&#x202f;1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;(√&#xfeff;2 cos&#x202f;β). If then we
call our vertical, transverse</p>

<div class="dmaths">
<p class="pcontinue">and oblique partitions, <i>V</i>, <i>T</i>, and <i>O</i>,
we have <i>V</i>
=&#x202f;tan&#x202f;β; <i>T</i>
=&#x202f;√&#xfeff;2; and <i>O</i>
=&#x202f;1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;(√&#xfeff;2 cos&#x202f;β), or</p>

cos&#x202f;β).</div>

<p class="pcontinue">And, working out these equations
for various values of β, we very soon see that the
vertical partition (<i>V</i>) is the least of the three until β
=&#x202f;45°, at which limit <i>V</i> and <i>O</i> are each equal to
1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;√&#xfeff;2

=&#x202f;1, after which
<i>T</i> (whose value always
=&#x202f;1) is the shortest of the
three partitions. And, as we have seen, these results are at
once applicable, not only to the case of the plane triangle,
but also to that of the conical cell.</p>

<div class="dctr03" id="fig141">
<img src="images/i353b.png" width="653" height="196" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 141.</div></div>

<p>In like manner, if we have a spheroidal body, less than
a hemisphere, such for instance as a low, watch-glass shaped
cell (Fig. <a href="#fig141" title="go to Fig. 141">141</a>, <i>a</i>), it is obvious that the smallest possible
partition by which we can divide it into
two equal halves <span class="xxpn" id="p354">{354}</span>
is (as in our flattened disc) a median vertical one. And
likewise, the hemisphere itself can be bisected by no smaller
partition meeting the walls at right angles than that median
one which divides it into two similar quadrants of a sphere.
But if we produce our hemisphere into a more elevated, conical
body, or into a cylinder with spherical cap, it is obvious that there
comes a point where a transverse, horizontal partition will bisect
the figure with less area of partition-wall than a median vertical
one (<i>c</i>). And furthermore, there will be an intermediate region,
a region where height and base have their relative dimensions
nearly equal (as in <i>b</i>), where an oblique partition will be better
than either the vertical or the transverse, though here the analogy
of our triangle does not suffice to give us the precise limiting
values. We need not examine these limitations in detail, but we
must look at the curvatures which accompany the several conditions.
We have seen that a film tends to set itself at equal
angles to the surface which it meets, and therefore, when that
surface is a solid, to meet it (or its tangent if it be a curved surface)
at right angles. Our <i>vertical</i> partition is, therefore, everywhere
normal to the original cell-walls, and constitutes a plane surface.</p>

<p>But in the taller, conical cell with transverse partition, the
latter still meets the opposite sides of the cell at right angles, and
it follows that it must itself be curved; moreover, since the
tension, and therefore the curvature, of the partition is everywhere
uniform, it follows that its curved surface must be a portion
of a sphere, concave towards the apex of the original, now divided,
cell. In the intermediate case, where we have an oblique partition,
meeting both the base and the curved sides of the mother-cell,
the contact must still be everywhere at right angles: provided
we continue to suppose that the walls of the mother-cell (like those
of our diagrammatic cube) have become practically rigid before
the partition appears, and are therefore not affected and deformed
by the tension of the latter. In such a case, and especially when
the cell is elliptical in cross-section, or is still more complicated
in form, it is evident that the partition, in adapting itself to
circumstances and in maintaining itself as a surface of minimal
area subject to all the conditions of the case, may have to assume
a complex curvature. <span class="xxpn" id="p355">{355}</span></p>

 (after Reinke); <i>B</i>, from paraphyses of <i>Fucus</i>;
 <i>C</i>, from rhizoids of Moss; <i>D</i>, from paraphyses of
 <i>Polytrichum</i>.</div></div>

<p>While in very many cases the partitions (like the walls of the
original cell) will be either plane or spherical, a more complex
curvature will be assumed under a variety of conditions. It will
be apt to occur, for instance, when the mother-cell is irregular in
shape, and one particular case of such asymmetry will be that in
which (as in Fig. <a href="#fig143" title="go to Fig. 143">143</a>) the cell has begun to branch, or give off a
diverticulum, before division takes place. A very complicated
case of a different kind, though not without its analogies to the
cases we are considering, will occur in the partitions of minimal
area which subdivide the spiral tube of a nautilus, as we shall
presently see. And again, whenever we have a marked internal
asymmetry of the cell, leading to irregular and anomalous modes
of division, in which the cell is not necessarily divided into two
equal halves and in which the partition-wall may assume an
oblique position, then apparently anomalous curvatures will tend
to make their appearance<a class="afnanch" href="#fn388" id="fnanch388">388</a>.</p>

<p>Suppose that a more or less oblong cell have a tendency to
divide by means of an oblique partition (as may happen through
various causes or conditions of asymmetry), such a partition will
still have a tendency to set itself at right
angles to the rigid walls <span class="xxpn" id="p356">{356}</span>
of the mother-cell: and it will at once follow that our oblique
partition, throughout its whole extent, will assume the form of
a complex, saddle-shaped or anticlastic surface.</p>

<p>Many such cases of partitions with complex or double curvature
exist, but they are not always easy of recognition, nor is the
particular case where they appear in a <i>terminal</i> cell a common
one. We may see them, for instance, in the roots (or rhizoids)
of Mosses, especially at the point of development of a new rootlet
(Fig. <a href="#fig142" title="go to Fig. 142">142</a>, C); and again among Mosses, in the “paraphyses” of
the male prothalli (e.g. in <i>Polytrichum</i>), we find more or less
similar partitions (D). They are frequent also among many Fuci,
as in the hairs or paraphyses of Fucus itself (B). In <i>Taonia
atomaria</i>, as figured in Reinke’s memoir on the Dictyotaceae of
the Gulf of Naples<a class="afnanch" href="#fn389" id="fnanch389">389</a>,
we see, in like manner, <i>oblique</i> partitions,
which on more careful examination are seen to be curves of
double curvature (Fig. <a href="#fig142" title="go to Fig. 142">142</a>, A).</p>

<p>The physical cause and origin of these
<span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-a"
src="images/glyph-s.png" width="32" height="46" alt="S" />-shaped</span>
partitions is
somewhat obscure, but we may attempt a tentative explanation.
When we assert a tendency for the cell to divide transversely to
its long axis, we are not only stating empirically that the partition
tends to appear in a small, rather than a large cross-section of the
cell: but we are also implicitly ascribing to the cell a longitudinal
<i>polarity</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig143" title="go to Fig. 143">143</a>, A), and implicitly asserting
that it tends to <span class="xxpn" id="p357">{357}</span>
divide (just as the segmenting egg does), by a partition transverse
to its polar axis. Such a polarity may conceivably be due to
a chemical asymmetry, or anisotropy, such as we have learned
of (from Professor Macallum’s experiments) in our chapter on
Adsorption. Now if the chemical concentration, on which this
anisotropy or polarity (by hypothesis) depends, be unsymmetrical,
one of its poles being as it were deflected to one side, where a little
branch or bud is being (or about to be) given off,—all in precise
accordance with the adsorption phenomena described on p. <a href="#p289" title="go to pg. 289">289</a>,—then
our “polar axis” would necessarily be a curved axis, and the
partition, being constrained (again <i>ex hypothesi</i>) to arise transversely
to the polar axis, would lie obliquely to the <i>apparent</i> axis of the
cell (Fig. <a href="#fig143" title="go to Fig. 143">143</a>, B, C). And if the oblique partition be so situated
that it has to meet the <i>opposite</i> walls (as in C), then, in order to
do so symmetrically (i.e. either perpendicularly, as when the
cell-wall is already solidified, or at least at equal angles on either
side), it is evident that the partition, in its course from one side
of the cell to the other, must necessarily assume a more or less
<span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-a"
src="images/glyph-s.png" width="32" height="46" alt="S" />-shaped</span>
curvature (Fig. <a href="#fig143" title="go to Fig. 143">143</a>, D).</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, while we have abundant simple illustrations
of the principles which we have now begun to study, apparent
exceptions to this simplicity, due to an asymmetry of the cell
itself, or of the system of which the single cell is but a part, are
by no means rare. For example, we know that in cambium-cells,
division frequently takes place parallel to the long axis of the
cell, when a partition of much less area would suffice if it were
set cross-ways: and it is only when a considerable disproportion
has been set up between the length and breadth of the cell, that
the balance is in part redressed by the appearance of a transverse
partition. It was owing to such exceptions that Berthold was
led to qualify and even to depreciate the importance of the law
of minimal areas as a factor in cell-division, after he himself had
done so much to demonstrate and elucidate it<a class="afnanch" href="#fn390" id="fnanch390">390</a>.
He was deeply
and rightly impressed by the fact that other forces
besides surface <span class="xxpn" id="p358">{358}</span>
tension, both external and internal to the cell, play their part
in the determination of its partitions, and that the answer to
our problem is not to be given in a word. How fundamentally
important it is, however, in spite of all conflicting tendencies and
apparent exceptions, we shall see better and better as we proceed.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>But let us leave the exceptions and return to a consideration
of the simpler and more general phenomena. And in so doing,
let us leave the case of the cubical, quadrangular or cylindrical
cell, and examine the case of a spherical cell and of its successive
divisions, or the still simpler case of a circular, discoidal cell.</p>

<p>When we attempt to in­ves­ti­gate math­e­mat­i­cally the position
and form of a partition of minimal area, it is plain that we shall
be dealing with comparatively simple cases wherever even one
dimension of the cell is much less than the other two. Where two
dimensions are small compared with the third, as in a thin cylindrical
filament like that of Spirogyra, we have the problem at its
simplest; for it is at once obvious, then, that the partition must
lie transversely to the long axis of the thread. But even where
one dimension only is relatively small, as for instance in a flattened
plate, our problem is so far simplified that we see at once that the
partition cannot be parallel to the extended plane, but must cut
the cell, somehow, at right angles to that plane. In short, the
problem of dividing a much flattened solid becomes identical with
that of dividing a simple <i>surface</i> of the same form.</p>

<p>There are a number of small Algae, growing in the form of
small flattened discs, consisting (for a time at any rate) of but a
single layer of cells, which, as Berthold shewed, exemplify this
comparatively simple problem; and we shall find presently that
it is also admirably illustrated in the cell-divisions which occur in
the egg of a frog or a sea-urchin, when the egg for the sake of
experiment is flattened out under artificial pressure.</p>

<i>Erythrotrichia discigera</i>; and it will be seen that, in all stages save
the first, we have an arrangement of cell-partitions which looks
somewhat complex, but into which we must attempt to throw some
light and order. Starting with the original
single, and flattened, <span class="xxpn" id="p359">{359}</span>
cell, we have no difficulty with the first two cell-divisions; for
we know that no bisecting partitions can possibly be shorter than
the two diameters, which divide the cell into halves and into
quarters. We have only to remember that, for the sum total of
partitions to be a minimum, three only must meet in a point;
and therefore, the four quadrantal walls must shift a little, producing
the usual little median partition, or cross-furrow, instead
of one common, central point of junction. This little intermediate
wall, however, will be very small, and to all intents and purposes</p>

 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 145.</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">we may deal with the case as
though we had now to do with four equal cells, each
one of them a perfect quadrant. And so our problem
is, to find the shortest line which shall divide the
quadrant of a circle into two halves of equal area. A
radial partition (Fig. <a href="#fig145" title="go to Fig. 145">145</a>, <span class="nowrap"><span
class="smmaj">A</span>),</span> starting from the apex of
the quadrant, is at once excluded, for a reason similar
to that just referred to; our choice must lie therefore
between two modes of division such as are illustrated
in Fig. <a href="#fig145" title="go to Fig. 145">145</a>, where the partition is either (as in <span
class="nowrap"><span class="smmaj">B</span>)</span>
<span class="xxpn" id="p360">{360}</span> concentric
with the outer border of the cell, or else (as in <span
class="nowrap"><span class="smmaj">C</span>)</span> cuts
that outer border; in other words, our partition may <span
class="nowrap">(<span class="smmaj">B</span>)</span>
cut <i>both</i> radial walls, or <span class="nowrap">(<span
class="smmaj">C</span>)</span> may cut <i>one</i> radial
wall and the periphery. These are the two methods
of division which Sachs called, respectively, <span

<i>periclinal</i>, and <span class="nowrap">(<span
class="smmaj">C</span>)</span> <i>anticlinal</i>&#xfeff;<a
class="afnanch" href="#fn391" id="fnanch391">391</a>.
We may either treat the walls of the dividing quadrant
as already solidified, or at least as having a tension
compared with which that of the incipient partition film
is inconsiderable. In either case the partition must meet
the cell-wall, on either side, at right angles, and (its
own tension and curvature being everywhere uniform) it must
take the form of a circular arc.<br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<p>Now we find that a flattened cell which is ap­prox­i­mate­ly
a quadrant of a circle invariably divides after the manner
of Fig. <a href="#fig145" title="go to Fig. 145">145</a>, <span class="smmaj">C,</span> that is to say,
by an ap­prox­i­mate­ly circular, <i>anticlinal</i> wall, such as we
now recognise in the eight-celled stage of Erythrotrichia

problem for us, and let us work out the actual geometric
conditions.</p>

<p>We see accordingly that the equation is solved (as accurately
as need be) when θ is an angle somewhat over 34°&#x202f;38&#xfeff;′, or say
34°&#x202f;38½&#xfeff;′. That is to say, a quadrant of a circle is bisected by a
circular arc cutting the side and the periphery of the quadrant
at right angles, when the arc is such as to include (90°&#x202f;−&#x202f;34°&#x202f;38&#xfeff;′),
i.e. 55°&#x202f;22&#xfeff;′ of the quadrantal arc.</p>

<p>This determination of ours is practically identical with that
which Berthold arrived at by a rough and ready method, without
the use of mathematics. He simply tried various ways of dividing
a quadrant of paper by means of a circular arc, and went on doing
so till he got the weights of his two pieces of paper ap­prox­i­mate­ly
equal. The angle, as he thus determined it, was 34·6°, or say
34°&#x202f;36&#xfeff;′.</p></li>

<li><p>(2) The position of <i>M</i> on the side of
the quadrant <i>OA</i> is given by the equation <i>OM</i>
=&#x202f;<i>a</i>&#x202f;cosec&#x202f;θ&#x202f;−&#x202f;<i>a</i>&#x202f;cot&#x202f;θ;
the value of which expression, for the angle which we have just
discovered, is ·3028. That is to say, the radius (or side) of
the quadrant will be divided by the new partition into two
parts, in the proportions of nearly three to seven.</p></li>

<li><p>(3) The length of the arc <i>MP</i> is equal to
<i>a</i>&#x202f;θ&#x202f;cot&#x202f;θ; and the
value of this for the given angle is ·8751. This is as much as to
say that the curved partition-wall which we are considering is
shorter than a radial partition in the proportion of 8¾ to 10, or
seven-eights almost exactly.</p></li></ul>

<div class="dleft dwth-g" id="fig147">
<img src="images/i362.png" width="226" height="220" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 147.</div></div>

<p>But we must also compare the length of this curved “anticlinal”
partition-wall (<i>MP</i>) with that of the concentric,
or periclinal, one (<i>RS</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig147" title="go to Fig. 147">147</a>) by
which the quadrant might also be bisected.
The length of this partition is obviously
equal to the arc of the quadrant (i.e. the
peripheral wall of the cell) divided by √&#xfeff;2;
or, in terms of the radius,
=&#x202f;π&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;2&#x202f;√&#xfeff;2
=&#x202f;1·111.
So that, not only is the anticlinal partition
(such as we actually find in nature) notably the best, but the
periclinal one, when it comes to dividing an entire quadrant, is
very considerably larger even than a radial partition.
<br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<p>The two cells into which our original quadrant is now divided,
while they are equal in volume, are of very
different shapes; the <span class="xxpn" id="p363">{363}</span>
one is a triangle (<i>MAP</i>) with two sides formed of circular arcs,
and the other is a four-sided figure (<i>MOBP</i>), which we may call
ap­prox­i­mate­ly oblong. We cannot say as yet how the triangular
portion ought to divide; but it is obvious that the least possible
partition-wall which shall bisect the other must run across the
long axis of the oblong, that is to say periclinally. This, also, is
precisely what tends actually to take place. In the following
diagrams (Fig. <a href="#fig148" title="go to Fig. 148">148</a>) of a frog’s egg dividing under pressure, that
is to say when reduced to the form of a flattened plate, we see,
firstly, the division into four quadrants (by the partitions 1, 2);
secondly, the division of each quadrant by means of an anticlinal
circular arc (3, 3), cutting the peripheral wall of the quadrant
ap­prox­i­mate­ly in the</p>

 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 148. Segmentation of frog’s egg, under
 artificial compression. (After Roux.)</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">proportions of three to seven; and thirdly,
we see that of the eight cells (four triangular and four oblong)
into which the whole egg is now divided, the four which we have
called oblong now proceed to divide by partitions transverse to
their long axes, or roughly parallel to the periphery of the egg.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The question how the other, or triangular, portion of the divided
quadrant will next divide leads us to another well-defined problem,
which is only a slight extension, making allowance for the circular
arcs, of that elementary problem of the triangle we have already
considered. We know now that an entire quadrant must divide
(so that its bisecting wall shall have the least possible area) by
means of an anticlinal partition, but how about any smaller
sectors of circles? It is obvious in the case of
a small prismatic <span class="xxpn" id="p364">{364}</span>
sector, such as that shewn in Fig. <a href="#fig149" title="go to Fig. 149">149</a>, that a <i>periclinal</i> partition
is the smallest by which we can possibly bisect the cell; we want,
accordingly, to know the limits below which the periclinal partition
is always the best, and above which the anticlinal arc, as in the
case of the whole quadrant, has the advantage in regard to smallness
of surface area.</p>

<p>This may be easily determined; for the preceding
in­ves­ti­ga­tion is a perfectly general one, and the results hold
good for sectors of any other arc, as well as for the quadrant,
or arc of 90°. That is to say, the length of the partition-wall
<i>MP</i> is always determined by the angle θ, according to our
equation <i>MP</i>
=&#x202f;<i>a</i>&#x202f;θ&#x202f;cot&#x202f;θ; and the angle
θ has a definite relation to α, the angle of arc.</p>

 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 149.</div></div>

<div class="dmaths">
<p>Moreover, in the case of the periclinal boundary, <i>RS</i>
(Fig. <a href="#fig147" title="go to Fig. 147">147</a>)
(or <i>ab</i>, Fig. <a href="#fig149" title="go to Fig.

<p>In the accompanying diagram (Fig. <a href="#fig150" title="go to Fig. 150">150</a>), I have plotted the
various magnitudes with which we are concerned, in order to
exhibit the several limiting values. Here we see, in the first
place, the curve marked α, which shews on the (left-hand) vertical
scale the various possible magnitudes of that angle
(viz. the angle <span class="xxpn" id="p365">{365}</span>
of arc of the whole sector which we wish to divide), and on the
horizontal scale the cor­re­spon­ding values of θ, or the angle which
determines</p>

<div class="dctr01" id="fig150">
<img src="images/i365.png" width="800" height="931" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 150.</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">the point on the periphery where it is cut by the
partition-wall, <i>MP</i>. Two limiting cases are to be noticed here:
(1) at 90° (point <i>A</i> in diagram), because we are
at present only <span class="xxpn" id="p366">{366}</span>
dealing with arcs no greater than a quadrant; and (2), the point
(<i>B</i>) where the angle θ comes to equal the angle α, for after that
point the construction becomes impossible, since an anticlinal
bisecting partition-wall would be partly outside the cell. The only
partition which, after the point, can possibly exist, is a periclinal
one. This point, as our diagram shews us, occurs when the angles
(α and θ) are each rather under 52°.</p>

<p>Next I have plotted, on the same diagram, and in relation to
the same scales of angles, the cor­re­spon­ding lengths of the two
partitions, viz. <i>RS</i> and <i>MP</i>, their lengths being expressed (on
the right-hand side of the diagram) in relation to the radius of
the circle (<i>a</i>), that is to say the side wall, <i>OA</i>, of our cell.</p>

<p>The limiting values here are (1), <i>C</i>, <i>C&#xfeff;′</i>, where the angle of arc
is 90°, and where, as we have already seen, the two partition-walls
have the relative magnitudes of <i>MP</i>&#x202f;:&#x202f;<i>RS</i>
=&#x202f;0·875&#x202f;:&#x202f;1·111; (2) the
point <i>D</i>, where <i>RS</i> equals unity, that is to say where the periclinal
partition has the same length as a radial one; this occurs when
α is rather under 82° (cf. the points <i>D</i>, <i>D&#xfeff;′</i>); (3) the point <i>E</i>, where
<i>RS</i> and <i>MP</i> intersect; that is to say the point at which the two
partitions, periclinal and anticlinal, are of the same magnitude;
this is the case, according to our diagram, when the angle of arc
is just over 62½°. We see from this, then, that what we have
called an anticlinal partition, as <i>MP</i>, is only likely to occur in
a triangular or prismatic cell whose angle of arc lies between
90° and 62½°. In all narrower or more tapering cells, the periclinal
partition will be of less area, and will therefore be more and more
likely to occur.</p>

<p>The case (<i>F</i>) where the angle α is just 60° is of some interest.
Here, owing to the curvature of the peripheral border, and the
consequent fact that the peripheral angles are somewhat greater
than the apical angle α, the periclinal partition has a very slight
and almost imperceptible advantage over the anticlinal, the
relative proportions being about as <i>MP</i>&#x202f;:&#x202f;<i>RS</i>
=&#x202f;0·73&#x202f;:&#x202f;0·72. But if
the equilateral triangle be a plane spherical triangle, i.e. a plane
triangle bounded by circular arcs, then we see that there is no
longer any distinction at all between our two partitions; <i>MP</i>
and <i>RS</i> are now identical.</p>

<p>On the same diagram, I have inserted the curve
for values of <span class="xxpn" id="p367">{367}</span>
cosec&#x202f;θ&#x202f;−&#x202f;cot&#x202f;θ
=&#x202f;<i>OM</i>, that is to say the distances from the centre,
along the side of the cell, of the starting-point (<i>M</i>) of the anticlinal
partition. The point <i>C&#xfeff;″</i> represents its position in the case of
a quadrant, and shews it to be (as we have already said) about
3&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;10 of the length of the radius from the centre. If, on the other
hand, our cell be an equilateral triangle, then we have to read off
the point on this curve cor­re­spon­ding to α
=&#x202f;60°, and we find it
at the point <i>F‴</i> (vertically under <i>F</i>), which tells us that the
partition now starts 4·5&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;10, or nearly halfway, along the radial
wall.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The foregoing con­si­de­ra­tions carry us a long way in our
investigations of many of the simpler forms of cell-division.
Strictly speaking they are limited to the case of flattened cells,
in which we can treat the problem as though we were simply
partitioning a plane surface. But it is obvious that, though they
do not teach us the whole conformation of the partition which
divides a more complicated solid into two halves, yet they do, even
in such a case, enlighten us so far, that they tell us the appearance
presented in one plane of the actual solid. And as this is all that
we see in a microscopic section, it follows that the results we have
arrived at will greatly help us in the interpretation of microscopic
appearances, even in comparatively complex cases of cell-division.</p>

<div class="dright dwth-d" id="fig151">
<img src="images/i367.png" width="380" height="394" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 151.</div></div>

<p>Let us now return to our
quadrant cell (<i>OAPB</i>), which we
have found to be divided into
a triangular and a quadrilateral
portion, as in Fig. <a href="#fig147" title="go to Fig. 147">147</a> or Fig. <a href="#fig151" title="go to Fig. 151">151</a>;
and let us now suppose the whole
system to grow, in a uniform
fashion, as a prelude to further
subdivision. The whole quadrant,
growing uniformly (or with equal
radial increments), will still remain
a quadrant, and it is
obvious, therefore, that for every
new increment of size, more will
be added to the margin of its triangular portion
than to the <span class="xxpn" id="p368">{368}</span>
narrower margin of its quadrilateral portion; and these increments
will be in proportion to the angles of arc, viz. 55°&#x202f;22&#xfeff;′&#x202f;:&#x202f;34°&#x202f;38&#xfeff;′,
or as ·96&#x202f;:&#x202f;·60, i.e. as 8&#x202f;:&#x202f;5. And accordingly, if we may assume
(and the assumption is a very plausible one), that, just as the
quadrant itself divided into two halves after it got to a certain
size, so each of its two halves will reach the same size before
again dividing, it is obvious that the triangular portion will be
doubled in size, and therefore ready to divide, a considerable
time before the quadrilateral part. To work out the problem in
detail would lead us into troublesome mathematics; but if
we simply assume that the increments are proportional to the
increasing radii of the circle, we have the following equations:―</p>

<p>Let us call the triangular cell <i>T</i>, and the quadrilateral, <i>Q</i>
(Fig. <a href="#fig151" title="go to Fig. 151">151</a>); let the radius, <i>OA</i>, of the original quadrantal cell
=&#x202f;<i>a</i>
=&#x202f;1; and let the increment which is required to add on a
portion equal to <i>T</i> (such as <i>PP&#xfeff;′A&#xfeff;′A</i>) be called <i>x</i>, and let that
required, similarly, for the doubling of <i>Q</i> be called <i>x&#xfeff;′</i>.</p>

<p>This is as much as to say that, supposing each cell tends to
divide into two halves when (and not before) its original size is
doubled, then, in our flattened disc, the triangular cell <i>T</i> will tend
to divide when the radius of the disc has increased by about a
third (from 1 to 1·345), but the quadrilateral cell, <i>Q</i>, will not tend
to divide until the linear dimensions of the disc have increased
by about a half (from 1 to 1·517).</p>

<p>The case here illustrated is of no small general importance.
For it shews us that a uniform and symmetrical growth of the
organism (symmetrical, that is to say, under the limitations of a
plane surface, or plane section) by no means involves a uniform
or symmetrical growth of the individual cells, but may, under
certain conditions, actually lead to inequality among these; and
this inequality may be further emphasised by differences which
arise out of it, in regard to the order of frequency of further
subdivision. This phenomenon (or to be quite candid, this
hypothesis, which is due to Berthold) is entirely independent of
any change or variation in individual surface tensions; and
accordingly it is essentially different from the phenomenon of
unequal segmentation (as studied by Balfour), to which we have
referred on p. <a href="#p348" title="go to pg. 348">348</a>.</p>

<p>In this fashion, we might go on to consider the manner, and
the order of succession, in which the subsequent cell-divisions
would tend to take place, as governed by the principle of minimal
areas. But the calculations would grow more difficult, or the
results got by simple methods would grow less and less exact.
At the same time, some of these results would be of great interest,
and well worth the trouble of obtaining. For instance, the precise
manner in which our triangular cell, <i>T</i>, would next divide would
be interesting to know, and a general solution of this problem is
certainly troublesome to calculate. But in this particular case
we can see that the width of the triangular cell near <i>P</i> is so
obviously less than that near either of the other two angles, that
a circular arc cutting off that angle is bound to be the shortest
possible bisecting line; and that, in short, our triangular cell
will tend to subdivide, just like the original quadrant, into a
triangular and a quadrilateral portion.</p>

<p>But the case will be different next time, because
in this new <span class="xxpn" id="p370">{370}</span>
triangle, <i>PRQ</i>, the least width is near the innermost angle, that
at <i>Q</i>; and the bisecting circular arc will therefore be opposite to <i>Q</i>,
or (ap­prox­i­mate­ly) parallel to <i>PR</i>. The importance of this fact is
at once evident; for it means to say that there soon comes a
time when, whether by the division of triangles or of quadrilaterals,
we find only quadrilateral cells adjoining the periphery of our
circular disc. In the subsequent division of these quadrilaterals,
the partitions will arise transversely to their long axes, that is to
say, <i>radially</i> (as <i>U</i>, <i>V</i>); and we shall consequently have a superficial
or peripheral layer of quadrilateral cells, with sides ap­prox­i­mate­ly
parallel, that is to say what we are accustomed to call <i>an
epidermis</i>. And this epidermis or superficial layer will be in clear
contrast with the more irregularly shaped cells, the products of
triangles and quadrilaterals, which make up the deeper, underlying
layers of tissue.</p>

 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 152.</div></div>

<p>In following out these theoretic principles and others like to
them, in the actual division of living cells, we must always bear
in mind certain conditions and qualifications. In the first place,
the law of minimal area and the other rules which we have arrived
at are not absolute but relative: they are links, and very important
links, in a chain of physical causation; they are always at work,
but their effects may be overridden and concealed by the operation
of other forces. Secondly, we must remember that, in the great
majority of cases, the cell-system which we have in view is constantly
increasing in magnitude by active growth; and by this
means the form and also the proportions of the cells are continually
liable to alteration, of which phenomenon we have already had
an example. Thirdly, we must carefully remember that, until
our cell-walls become absolutely solid and rigid, they are always
apt to be modified in form owing to the tension
of the adjacent <span class="xxpn" id="p371">{371}</span>
walls; and again, that so long as our partition films are fluid or
semifluid, their points and lines of contact with one another may
shift, like the shifting outlines of a system of soap-bubbles. This
is the physical cause of the movements frequently seen among
segmenting cells, like those to which Rauber called attention in
the segmenting ovum of the frog, and like those more striking
movements or accommodations which give rise to a so-called
“spiral” type of segmentation.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Bearing in mind, then, these con­si­de­ra­tions, let us see what
our flattened disc is likely to look like, after a few successive
divisions</p>

<p class="pcontinue">into
component cells. In Fig. <a href="#fig153" title="go to Fig. 153">153</a>, <i>a</i>, we have a diagrammatic
representation of our disc, after it has divided into four
quadrants, and each of these in turn into a triangular and a
quadrilateral portion; but as yet, this figure scarcely suggests
to us anything like the normal look of an aggregate of living cells.
But let us go a little further, still limiting ourselves, however,
to the consideration of the eight-celled stage. Wherever one of
our radiating partitions meets the peripheral wall, there will (as
we know) be a mutual tension between the three convergent films,
which will tend to set their edges at equal angles to one another,
angles that is to say of 120°. In consequence of this, the outer
wall of each individual cell will (in this surface view
of our disc) <span class="xxpn" id="p372">{372}</span>
be an arc of a circle of which we can determine the centre by the
method used on p. <a href="#p307" title="go to pg. 307">307</a>; and, furthermore, the narrower cells,
that is to say the quadrilaterals, will have this outer border
somewhat more curved than their broader neighbours. We arrive,
then, at the condition shewn in Fig. <a href="#fig153" title="go to Fig. 153">153</a>, <i>b</i>. Within the cell,
also, wherever wall meets wall, the angle of contact must tend,
in every case, to be an angle of 120°; and in no case may more
than three films (as seen in section) meet in a point (<i>c</i>); and
this condition, of the partitions meeting three by three, and at
co-equal angles, will obviously involve the curvature of some, if
not all, of the partitions (<i>d</i>) which in our preliminary in­ves­ti­ga­tion
we treated as plane. To solve this problem in a general way is
no easy matter; but it is a problem which Nature solves in
every case where, as in the case we are considering, eight bubbles,
or eight cells, meet together in a (plane or curved) surface. An
ap­prox­i­mate solution has been given in Fig. <a href="#fig153" title="go to Fig. 153">153</a>, <i>d</i>; and it will now
at once be recognised that this figure has vastly more resemblance
to an aggregate of living cells than had the diagram of Fig. <a href="#fig153" title="go to Fig. 153">153</a>, <i>a</i>
with which we began.</p>

<img src="images/i372.png" width="116" height="126" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 154.</div></div>

<p>Just as we have constructed in this case a series of purely
diagrammatic or schematic figures, so it will be as a rule possible
to diagrammatise, with but little alteration, the
complicated appearances presented by any ordinary
aggregate of cells. The accompanying little figure
(Fig. <a href="#fig154" title="go to Fig. 154">154</a>), of a germinating spore of a Liverwort
(Riccia), after a drawing of Professor Campbell’s,
scarcely needs further explanation: for it is well-nigh a
typical diagram of the method of space-partitioning which we are
now considering. Let us look again at our figures (on p. <a href="#p359" title="go to pg. 359">359</a>) of the
disc of Erythrotrichia, from Berthold’s <i>Monograph of the Bangiaceae</i>
and redraw the earlier stages in diagrammatic fashion. In the
following series of diagrams the new partitions, or those just about
to form, are in each case outlined; and in the next succeeding
stage they are shewn after settling down into position, and after
exercising their respective tractions on the walls previously laid
down. It is clear, I think, that these four diagrammatic figures
represent all that is shewn in the first five stages drawn by
Berthold from the plant itself; but
the cor­re­spon­dence cannot <span class="xxpn" id="p373">{373}</span>
in this case be precisely accurate, for the simple reason that
Berthold’s figures are taken from different individuals, and are
therefore only ap­prox­i­mate­ly consecutive and not strictly continuous.
The last of the six drawings in Fig. <a href="#fig144" title="go to Fig. 144">144</a> is already too</p>

for us to decipher with certainty the precise order of

<p class="pcontinue">has divided, according to the theoretical plan, into about sixty-four
cells; and making due allowance for the successive changes
which the mutual tensions and tractions of
the partitions must <span class="xxpn" id="p374">{374}</span>
bring about, increasing in complexity with each succeeding stage,
we can see, even at this advanced and complicated stage, a very
considerable resemblance between the actual picture (Fig. <a href="#fig144" title="go to Fig. 144">144</a>)
and the diagram which we have here constructed in obedience to
a few simple rules.</p>

<p>In like manner, in the annexed figures, representing sections
through a young embryo of a Moss, we have very little difficulty
in discerning the successive stages that must have intervened
between the two stages shewn: so as to lead from the just divided
quadrants (one of which, by the way, has not yet divided in our
figure (<i>a</i>)) to the stage (<i>b</i>) in which a well-marked epidermal
layer surrounds an at first sight irregular agglomeration of
“fundamental” tissue.</p>

<p>In the last paragraph but one, I have spoken of the difficulty
of so arranging the meeting-places of a number of cells that at
each junction only three cell-walls shall meet in a line, and all
three shall meet it at equal angles of 120°. As a matter of fact, the
problem is soluble in a number of ways; that is to say, when we
have a number of cells, say eight as in the case considered, enclosed
in a common boundary, there are various ways in which their
walls can be made to meet internally, three by three, at equal
angles; and these differences will entail differences also in the
curvature of the walls, and consequently in the shape of the cells.
The question is somewhat complex; it has been dealt with by
Plateau, and treated math­e­mat­i­cally by M. Van Rees<a class="afnanch" href="#fn392" id="fnanch392">392</a>.</p>

<div class="dctr03" id="fig158">
<img src="images/i375.png" width="609" height="477" alt="" />
 <div class="pcaption">Fig. 158. Various possible
 arrangements of intermediate partitions, in groups of 4,
 5, 6, 7 or 8 cells.</div></div>

<p>If within our boundary we have three cells
all meeting <span class="xxpn" id="p375">{375}</span>
internally, they must meet in a point; furthermore, they tend to
do so at equal angles of 120°, and there is an end of the matter.
If we have four cells, then, as we have already seen, the conditions
are satisfied by interposing a little intermediate wall, the two
extremities of which constitute the meeting-points of three cells
each, and the upper edge of which marks the “polar furrow.”
Similarly, in the case of five cells, we require <i>two</i> little intermediate
walls, and two polar furrows; and we soon arrive at the rule that,
for <i>n</i> cells, we require
<i>n</i>&#x202f;−&#x202f;3
little longitudinal partitions (and
cor­re­spon­ding polar furrows), connecting the triple junctions of
the cells; and these little walls, like all the rest within the system,
must be inclined to one another at angles of 120°. Where we
have only one such wall (as in the case of four cells), or only two
(as in the case of five cells), there is no room for ambiguity. But
where we have three little connecting-walls, as in the case of six
cells, it is obvious that we can arrange them in three different
ways, as in the annexed Fig. <a href="#fig159" title="go to Fig. 159">159</a>. In the system of seven cells,
the four partitions can be arranged in four ways; and the five
partitions required in the case of eight cells can be arranged in no
less than thirteen different ways, of which Fig. <a href="#fig158" title="go to Fig. 158">158</a> shews some
half-dozen only. It does not follow that, so to
speak, these various <span class="xxpn" id="p376">{376}</span>
arrangements are all equally good; some are known to be much
more stable than others, and some have never yet been realised
in actual experiment.</p>

<p>The conditions which lead to the presence of any one of them,
in preference to another, are as yet, so far as I am aware, undetermined,
but to this point we shall return.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Examples of these various arrangements meet us at every
turn, and not only in cell-aggregates, but in various cases where
non-rigid and semi-fluid partitions (or partitions that were so to
begin with) meet together. And it is a necessary consequence of
this physical phenomenon, and of the limited and very small
number of possible arrangements, that we get similar appearances,
capable of representation by the same diagram, in the most
diverse fields of biology<a class="afnanch" href="#fn393" id="fnanch393">393</a>.</p>

<img src="images/i376.png" width="800" height="241" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 159.</div></div>

<p>Among the published figures of embryonic stages and other
cell aggregates, we only discern these little intermediate partitions
in cases where the investigator has drawn carefully just what lay
before him, without any preconceived notions as to radial or other
symmetry; but even in other cases we can generally recognise,
without much difficulty, what the actual arrangement was whereby
the cell-walls met together in equi­lib­rium. I have a strong suspicion
that a leaning towards Sachs’s Rule, that one cell-wall tends
to set itself at right angles to another cell-wall (a rule whose strict
limitations, and narrow range of application,
we have already <span class="xxpn" id="p377">{377}</span>
considered) is responsible for many inaccurate or incomplete
representations of the mutual arrangement of aggregated cells.</p>

<p>In the accompanying series of figures
(Figs. <a href="#fig160" title="go to Fig. 160">160</a>–167) I have <span class="xxpn" id="p378">{378}</span>
set forth a few aggregates of eight cells, mostly from drawings of
segmenting eggs. In some cases they shew clearly the manner
in which the cells meet one another, always at angles of 120°,
and always with the help of five intermediate boundary walls
within the eight-celled system; in other cases I have added a
slightly altered drawing, so as to shew, with as
little change as <span class="xxpn" id="p379">{379}</span>
possible, the arrangement of boundaries which probably actually
existed, and gave rise to the appearance which the observer drew.
These drawings may be compared with the various diagrams of
Fig. <a href="#fig158" title="go to Fig. 158">158</a>, in which some seven out of the possible thirteen arrangements
of five intermediate partitions (for a system of eight cells)
have been already set forth.</p>

<p>It will be seen that M. Robert-Tornow’s figure of the segmenting
egg of Trochus (Fig. <a href="#fig160" title="go to Fig. 160">160</a>) clearly shews the cells grouped after the
fashion of Fig. <a href="#fig158" title="go to Fig. 158">158</a>, <i>a</i>. In like manner, Mr Conklin’s figure of the
ascidian egg (<i>Cynthia</i>) shews equally clearly the arrangement <i>g</i>.</p>

<p>A sea-urchin egg, segmenting under pressure, as figured by
Driesch, scarcely requires any modification of the drawing to
appear as a diagram of the type <i>d</i>. Turning for a moment to a
botanical illustration, we have a figure of Pringsheim’s shewing an
eight-celled stage in the apex of the young cone of Salvinia; it
is in all probability referable, as in my modified diagram, to type
<i>c</i>. Beside it is figured a very different object, a segmenting egg
of the Ascidian <i>Pyrosoma</i>, after Korotneff; it may be that this
also is to be referred to type <i>c</i>, but I think it is more easily referable
to type <i>b</i>. For there is a difference between this diagram and
that of Salvinia, in that here apparently, of the pairs of lateral
cells, the upper and the lower cell are alternately the larger, while
in the diagram of Salvinia the lower lateral cells both appear much
larger than the upper ones; and this difference tallies with the
appearance produced if we fill in the eight cells according to the
type <i>b</i> or the type <i>c</i>. In the segmenting cuttlefish egg, there
is again a slight dubiety as to which type it should be referred to,
but it is in all probability referable, like Driesch’s Echinus egg,
to <i>d</i>. Lastly, I have copied from Roux a curious figure of the
egg of <i>Rana esculenta</i>, viewed from the animal pole, which appears
to me referable, in all probability, to type <i>g</i>. Of type <i>f</i>, in which
the five partitions form a figure with four re-entrant angles, that
is to say a figure representing the five sides of a hexagon, I have
found no examples among segmenting eggs, and that arrangement
in all probability is a very unstable one.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>It is obvious enough, without more ado, that these phenomena
are in the strictest and completest way common
to both plants <span class="xxpn" id="p380">{380}</span>
and animals. In other words they tally with, and they further
extend, the general and fundamental conclusions laid down by
Schwann, in his <i>Mikroskopische Untersuchungen über die Uebereinstimmung
in der Struktur und dem Wachsthum der Thiere und
Pflanzen</i>.</p>

<p>But now that we have seen how a certain limited number of
types of eight-celled segmentation (or of arrangements of eight
cell-partitions) appear and reappear, here and there, throughout
the whole world of organisms, there still remains the very important
question, whether <i>in each particular organism</i> the conditions are
such as to lead to one particular arrangement being predominant,
char­ac­ter­is­tic, or even invariable. In short, is a particular arrangement
of cell-partitions to be looked upon (as the published figures
of the embryologist are apt to suggest) as a <i>specific character</i>, or
at least a constant or normal character, of the particular organism?
The answer to this question is a direct negative, but it is only in
the work of the most careful and accurate observers that we find
it revealed. Rauber (whom we have more than once had occasion
to quote) was one of those embryologists who recorded just what
he saw, without prejudice or preconception; as Boerhaave said
of Swammerdam, <i>quod vidit id asseruit</i>. Now Rauber has put on
record a considerable number of variations in the arrangement of
the first eight cells, which form a discoid surface about the dorsal
(or “animal”) pole of the frog’s egg. In a certain number of
cases these figures are identical with one another in type, identical
(that is to say) save for slight differences in magnitude, relative
proportions, or orientation. But I have selected (Fig. <a href="#fig168" title="go to Fig. 168">168</a>) six
diagrammatic figures, which are all <i>essentially different</i>, and these
diagrams seem to me to bear intrinsic evidence of their accuracy:
the curvatures of the partition-walls, and the angles at which
they meet agree closely with the requirements of theory, and when
they depart from theoretical symmetry they do so only to the
slight extent which we should naturally expect in a material and
imperfectly homogeneous system<a class="afnanch" href="#fn395" id="fnanch395">395</a>.
<span class="xxpn" id="p381">{381}</span></p>

<p>Of these six illustrations, two are exceptional. In Fig. <a href="#fig168" title="go to Fig. 168">168</a>, 5,
we observe that one of the eight cells is surrounded on all sides
by the other seven. This is a perfectly natural condition, and
represents, like the rest, a phase of partial or conditional equi­lib­rium.
But it is not included in the series we are now considering,
which is restricted to the case of eight cells extending outwards
to a common boundary. The condition shewn in Fig. <a href="#fig168" title="go to Fig. 168">168</a>, 6, is
again peculiar, and is probably rare; but it is included under the
cases considered on p. <a href="#p312" title="go to pg. 312">312</a>, in which the cells are not in complete</p>

<p class="pcontinue">fluid contact, but are separated
by little droplets of extraneous matter; it needs no
further comment. But the other four cases are beautiful
diagrams of space-partitioning, similar to those we have
just been considering, but so exquisitely clear that they
need no modification, no “touching-up,” to exhibit their
math­e­mat­i­cal regularity. It will easily be recognised
that in Fig. <a href="#fig168" title="go to Fig. 168">168</a>, 1 and 2, we have the arrangements
cor­re­spon­ding to <i>a</i> and <i>d</i> of our diagram (Fig. <a href="#fig158" title="go to Fig. 158">158</a>):
but the other two (i.e. 3 and 4) represent other of the
thirteen possible arrangements, which are not included in
that <span class="xxpn" id="p382">{382}</span> diagram.
It would be a curious and interesting in­ves­ti­ga­tion to
ascertain, in a large number of frogs’ eggs, all at
this stage of development, the percentage of cases in
which these various arrangements occur, with a view of
correlating their frequency with the theoretical conditions
(so far as they are known, or can be ascertained) of
relative stability. One thing stands out as very certain
indeed: that the elementary diagram of the frog’s egg
commonly given in text-books of embryology,—in which the
cells are depicted as uniformly symmetrical quadrangular
bodies,—is entirely inaccurate and grossly misleading&#xfeff;<a
class="afnanch" href="#fn396" id="fnanch396">396</a>.</p>

<p>We now begin to realise the remarkable fact, which may even
appear a startling one to the biologist, that all possible groupings
or arrangements whatsoever of eight cells (where all take part in
the <i>surface</i> of the group, none being submerged or wholly enveloped
by the rest) are referable to some one or other of <i>thirteen</i> types or
forms. And that all the thousands and thousands of drawings
which diligent observers have made of such eight-celled structures,
animal or vegetable, anatomical, histological or embryological, are
one and all representations of some one or another of these thirteen
types:—or rather indeed of somewhat less than the whole thirteen,
for there is reason to believe that, out of the total number of
possible groupings, a certain small number are essentially unstable,
and have at best, in the concrete, but a transitory and evanescent
existence.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Before we leave this subject, on which a vast deal more might
be said, there are one or two points which we must not omit to
consider. Let us note, in the first place, that the appearance
which our plane diagrams suggest of inequality of the several
cells is apt to be deceptive; for the differences of magnitude
apparent in one plane may well be, and probably generally are,
balanced by equal and opposite differences in another. Secondly,
let us remark that the rule which we are
considering refers only <span class="xxpn" id="p383">{383}</span>
to angles, and to the number, not to the length of the intermediate
partitions; it is to a great extent by variations in the length of these
that the magnitudes of the cells may be equalised, or otherwise
balanced, and the whole system brought into equi­lib­rium. Lastly,
there is a curious point to consider, in regard to the number of
actual contacts, in the various cases, between cell and cell. If we
inspect the diagrams in Fig. <a href="#fig169" title="go to Fig. 169">169</a> (which represent three out of our
thirteen possible arrangements of eight cells) we shall see that, in
the case of type <i>b</i>, two cells are each in contact with two others,
two cells with three others, and four cells each with four other cells.
In type <i>a</i> four cells are each in contact with two, two with four,
and two with five. In type <i>f</i>, two are in contact with two, four
with three, and one with no less than seven. In all cases the</p>

<img src="images/i383.png" width="800" height="280" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 169.</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">number of contacts is twenty-six in all; or, in other words, there
are thirteen internal partitions, besides the eight peripheral walls.
For it is easy to see that, in all cases of <i>n</i> cells with a common
external boundary, the number of internal partitions is 2<i>n</i>&#x202f;−&#x202f;3;
or the number of what we call the internal or interfacial contacts
is 2(2<i>n</i>&#x202f;−&#x202f;3). But it would appear that the most stable arrangements
are those in which the total number of contacts is most
evenly divided, and the least stable are those in which some one
cell has, as in type <i>f</i>, a predominant number of contacts. In a
well-known series of experiments, Roux has shewn how, by means
of oil-drops, various arrangements, or aggregations, of cells can
be simulated; and in Fig. <a href="#fig170" title="go to Fig. 170">170</a> I shew a number of Roux’s figures,
and have ascribed them to what seem to be their appropriate
“types” among those which we have just
been considering; but <span class="xxpn" id="p384">{384}</span>
it will be observed that in these figures of Roux’s the drops are not
always in complete contact, a little air-bubble often keeping them
apart at their apical junctions, so that we see the configuration
towards which the system is <i>tending</i> rather than that which it has
fully attained<a class="afnanch" href="#fn397" id="fnanch397">397</a>.
The type which we have called <i>f</i> was found by
Roux to be unstable, the large (or apparently large) drop <i>a&#xfeff;″</i>
quickly passing into the centre of the system, and here taking up
a position of equi­lib­rium in which, as usual, three cells meet
throughout in a point, at equal angles, and in which, in this case,
all the cells have an equal number of “interfacial” contacts.</p>

Roux.) Figs. <a href="#fig4" title="go to Fig. 4">4</a>–6 represent successive changes in a single
system.</div></div>

<p>We need by no means be surprised to find that, in such
arrangements, the commonest and most stable distributions
are those in which the cell-contacts are distributed as
uniformly as possible between the several cells. We always
expect to find some such tendency to equality in cases
where we have to do with small oscillations on either side
of a symmetrical condition. <span class="xxpn" id="p385">{385}</span></p>

<p>The rules and principles which we have arrived at from the
point of view of surface tension have a much wider bearing than is
at once suggested by the problems to which we have applied them;
for in this elementary study of the cell-boundaries in a segmenting
egg or tissue we are on the verge of a difficult and important
subject in pure mathematics. It is a subject adumbrated by
Leibniz, studied somewhat more deeply by Euler, and greatly
developed of recent years. It is the <i>Geometria Situs</i> of Gauss, the
<i>Analysis Situs</i> of Riemann, the Theory of Partitions of Cayley,
and of Spatial Complexes of Listing<a class="afnanch" href="#fn398" id="fnanch398">398</a>.
The crucial point for the
biologist to comprehend is, that in a closed surface divided into
a number of faces, the arrangement of all the faces, lines and
points in the system is capable of analysis, and that, when the
number of faces or areas is small, the number of possible arrangements
is small also. This is the simple reason why we meet in
such a case as we have been discussing (viz. the arrangement of
a group or system of eight cells) with the same few types recurring
again and again in all sorts of organisms, plants as well as animals,
and with no relation to the lines of biological clas­si­fi­ca­tion: and
why, further, we find similar con­fi­gur­a­tions occurring to mark
the symmetry, not of cells merely, but of the parts and organs of
entire animals. The phenomena are not “functions,” or specific
characters, of this or that tissue or organism, but involve general
principles which lie within the province of the mathematician.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The theory of space-partitioning, to which the segmentation
of the egg gives us an easy practical introduction, is illustrated in
much more complex ways in other fields of natural history. A
very beautiful but immensely complicated case is furnished by
the “venation” of the wings of insects. Here we have sometimes
(as in the dragon-flies), a general reticulum of small, more or less
hexagonal “cells”: but in most other cases, in flies, bees, butterflies,
etc., we have a moderate number of cells, whose partitions
always impinge upon one another three by three, and whose
arrangement, therefore, includes of necessity a number of small
intermediate partitions, analogous to our
polar furrows. I think <span class="xxpn" id="p386">{386}</span>
that a math­e­mat­i­cal study of these, including an in­ves­ti­ga­tion of
the “deformation” of the wing (that is to say, of the changes in
shape and changes in the form of its “cells” which it undergoes
during the life of the individual, and from one species to another)
would be of great interest. In very many cases, the entomologist
relies upon this venation, and upon the occurrence of this or that
intermediate vein, for his clas­si­fi­ca­tion, and therefore for his
hypothetical phylogeny of particular groups; which latter procedure
hardly commends itself to the physicist or the mathematician.</p>

 Ehr.; (B, C) <i>A. variabilis</i>, Grev. (After Greville.)</div></div>

<p>Another case, geometrically akin but biologically very
different, is to be found in the little diatoms of the genus Asterolampra,
and their immediate congeners<a class="afnanch" href="#fn399" id="fnanch399">399</a>.
In Asterolampra we
have a little disc, in which we see (as it were) radiating spokes of
one material, alternating with intervals occupied on the flattened
wheel-like disc by another (Fig. <a href="#fig171" title="go to Fig. 171">171</a>). The spokes vary in number,
but the general appearance is in a high degree suggestive of the
Chladni figures produced by the vibration of a circular plate.
The spokes broaden out towards the centre, and interlock by
visible junctions, which obey the rule of triple intersection, and
accordingly exemplify the partition-figures with which we are
dealing. But whereas we have found the particular arrangement
in which one cell is in contact with all the rest to be unstable,
according to Roux’s oil-drop experiments,
and to be conspicuous <span class="xxpn" id="p387">{387}</span>
by its absence from our diagrams of segmenting eggs, here in
Asterolampra, on the other hand, it occurs frequently, and is
indeed the commonest arrangement<a class="afnanch" href="#fn400" id="fnanch400">400</a>
(Fig. <a href="#fig171" title="go to Fig. 171">171</a>, B). In all probability,
we are entitled to consider this marked difference natural
enough. For we may suppose that in Asterolampra (unlike the
case of the segmenting egg) the tendency is to perfect radial
symmetry, all the spokes emanating from a point in the centre:
such a condition would be eminently unstable, and would break
down under the least asymmetry. A very simple, perhaps the
simplest case, would be that one single spoke should differ slightly
from the rest, and should so tend to be drawn in amid the others,
these latter remaining similar and symmetrical among themselves.
Such a configuration would be vastly less unstable than the
original one in which all the boundaries meet in a point; and the
fact that further progress is not made towards other con­fi­gur­a­tions
of still greater stability may be sufficiently accounted for by
viscosity, rapid solidification, or other conditions of restraint.
A perfectly stable condition would of course be obtained if, as in
the case of Roux’s oil-drop (Fig. <a href="#fig170" title="go to Fig. 170">170</a>, 6), one of the cellular spaces
passed into the centre of the system, the other partitions radiating
outwards from its circular wall to the periphery of the whole
system. Precisely such a condition occurs among our diatoms;
but when it does so, it is looked
upon as the mark and characterisation
of the <i>allied genus</i> Arachnoidiscus.</p>

<p>In a diagrammatic section of an Al­cyo­nar­ian po­lype (Fig.

there is no dif­fi­culty, for it is obvious that, throughout
the system, three boundaries meet (in plane section) in a
point. In many corals we have as <span class="xxpn" id="p388">{388}</span>
simple, or even simpler conditions, for the radiating calcified
partitions either converge upon a central chamber, or fail to
meet it and end freely. But in a few cases, the partitions or
“septa” converge to meet <i>one another</i>, there being no central
chamber on which they may impinge; and here the manner in
which contact is effected becomes complicated, and involves
problems identical with those which we are now studying.

(After Nicholson.)</div></div>

<p>In the great majority of corals we have as simple or
even simpler conditions than those of Alcyonium; for as a
rule the calcified partitions or septa of the coral either
converge upon a central chamber (or central “columella”),
or else fail to meet it and end freely. In the latter
case the problem of space-partitioning does not arise; in
the former, however numerous the septa be, their separate
contacts with the wall of the central chamber comply with
our fundamental rule according to which three lines and no
more meet in a point, and from this simple and symmetrical
arrangement there is little tendency to variation. But
in a few cases, the septal partitions converge to meet
<i>one another</i>, there being no central chamber on which
they may impinge; and here the manner in which contact
is effected becomes complicated, and involves problems
of space-partitioning identical with those which we are
now studying. In the genus Heterophyllia and in a few
allied forms we have such conditions, and students of
the Coelenterata have found them very puzzling. McCoy&#xfeff;<a
class="afnanch" href="#fn401" id="fnanch401">401</a>,
their first discoverer, pronounced these corals to be
“totally unlike” any other group, recent or fossil; and
Professor Martin Duncan, writing a memoir on Heterophyllia
and its allies<a class="afnanch" href="#fn402"
id="fnanch402">402</a>, described them as “paradoxical in
their anatomy.” <br class="brclrfix" /></p>

 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 174. <i>Heterophyllia</i> sp.
 (After Martin Duncan.)</div></div>

<p>The simplest or youngest Heterophylliae known have six septa
(as in Fig. <a href="#fig174" title="go to Fig. 174">174</a>, <i>a</i>); in the case figured, four of these septa are
conjoined two and two, thus forming the usual triple junctions
together with their intermediate
partition-walls: and in the <span class="xxpn" id="p389">{389}</span>
case of the other two we may fairly assume that their proper
and original arrangement was that of our type 6<i>b</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig158" title="go to Fig. 158">158</a>),
though the central intermediate partition has been crowded out
by partial coalescence. When with increasing age the septa
become more numerous, their arrangement becomes exceedingly
variable; for the simple reason that, from the math­e­mat­i­cal
point of view, the number of possible arrangements, of 10, 12
or more cellular partitions in triple contact, tends to increase
with great rapidity, and there is little to choose between many
of them in regard to symmetry and equi­lib­rium. But while,
math­e­mat­i­cally speaking, each particular case among the multitude
of possible cases is an orderly and definite arrangement,
from the purely biological point of view on the other hand no
law or order is recognisable; and so McCoy described the genus
as being characterised by the possession of septa “destitute of any
order of arrangement, but irregularly branching and coalescing in
their passage from the solid external walls towards some indefinite
point near the centre where the few main lamellae irregularly
anastomose.” <span class="xxpn" id="p390">{390}</span></p>

<p>In the two examples figured (Fig. <a href="#fig174" title="go to Fig. 174">174</a>), both comparatively
simple ones, it will be seen that, of the main chambers, one is in
each case an unsymmetrical one; that is to say, there is one
chamber which is in contact with a greater number of its neighbours
than any other, and which at an earlier stage must have had
contact with them all; this was the case of our type <i>f</i>, in the
eight-celled system (Fig. <a href="#fig158" title="go to Fig. 158">158</a>). Such an asymmetrical chamber
(which may occur in a system of any number of cells greater than
six), constitutes what is known to students of the Coelenterata as
a “fossula”; and we may recognise it not only here, but also in
Zaphrentis and its allies, and in a good many other corals besides.
Moreover certain corals are described as having more than one
fossula: this appearance being naturally produced under certain
of the other asymmetrical variations of normal space-partitioning.
Where a single fossula occurs, we are usually told that it is a
symptom of “bilaterality”; and this is in turn interpreted as
an indication of a higher grade of organisation than is implied
in the purely “radial symmetry” of the commoner types of coral.
The math­e­mat­i­cal aspect of the case gives no warrant for this
interpretation.</p>

<p>Let us carefully notice (lest we run the risk of confusing two
distinct problems) that the space-partitioning of Heterophyllia
by no means agrees with the details of that which we have studied
in (for instance) the case of the developing disc of Erythrotrichia:
the difference simply being that Heterophyllia illustrates the
general case of cell-partitioning as Plateau and Van Rees studied
it, while in Erythrotrichia, and in our other embryological and
histological instances, we have found ourselves justified in making
the additional assumption that each new partition divided a cell
into <i>co-equal parts</i>. No such law holds in Heterophyllia, whose
case is essentially different from the others: inasmuch as the
chambers whose partition we are discussing in the coral are mere
empty spaces (empty save for the mere access of sea-water); while
in our histological and embryological instances, we were speaking
of the division of a cellular unit of living protoplasm. Accordingly,
among other differences, the “transverse” or “periclinal” partitions,
which were bound to appear at regular intervals and in
definite positions, when co-equal bisection was a
feature of the <span class="xxpn" id="p391">{391}</span>
case, are comparatively few and irregular in the earlier stages of
Heterophyllia, though they begin to appear in numbers after the
main, more or less radial, partitions have become numerous, and
when accordingly these radiating partitions come to bound narrow
and almost parallel-sided interspaces; then it is that the transverse
or periclinal partitions begin to come in, and form what the student
of the Coelenterata calls the “dissepiments” of the coral. We
need go no further into the configuration and anatomy of the
corals; but it seems to me beyond a doubt that the whole question
of the complicated arrangement of septa and dissepiments throughout
the group (including the curious vesicular or bubble-like
tissue of the Cyathophyllidae and the general structural plan of
the Tetracoralla,</p>

<p class="pcontinue">such as Streptoplasma and its allies) is well
worth in­ves­ti­ga­tion from the physical and math­e­mat­i­cal point of
view, after the fashion which is here slightly adumbrated.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The method of dividing a circular, or spherical, system into
eight parts, equal as to their areas but unequal in their peripheral
boundaries, is probably of wide biological application; that is to
say, without necessarily supposing it to be rigorously followed, the
typical configuration which it yields seems to recur again and
again, with more or less approximation to precision, and under
widely different circumstances. I am inclined to think, for instance,
that the unequal division of the surface of a
Ctenophore by its <span class="xxpn" id="p392">{392}</span>
meridian-like ciliated bands is a case in point (Fig. <a href="#fig175" title="go to Fig. 175">175</a>). Here, if we
imagine each quadrant to be twice bisected by a curved anticline,
we shall get what is apparently a close approximation to the actual
position of the ciliated bands. The case however is complicated
by the fact that the sectional plan of the organism is never quite
circular, but always more or less elliptical. One point, at least,
is clearly seen in the symmetry of the Ctenophores; and that is
that the radiating canals which pass outwards to correspond in
position with the ciliated bands, have no common centre, but
diverge from one another by repeated bifurcations, in a manner
comparable to the conjunctions of our cell-walls.</p>

<p>In like manner I am inclined to suggest that the same principle
may help us to understand the apparently complex arrangement
of the skeletal rods of a larval Echinoderm, and the very complex
conformation of the larva which is brought about by the presence
of these long, slender skeletal radii.</p>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig176" title="go to Fig. 176">176</a> I have divided a circle into its four quadrants, and
have bisected each quadrant by a circular arc (<i>BC</i>), passing from
radius to periphery, as in the foregoing cases of cell-division; and
I have again bisected, in a similar way, the triangular halves of
each quadrant (<i>DD</i>). I have also inserted a small circle in the
middle of the figure, concentric with the large one. If now we
imagine those lines in the figure which I have drawn black to be
replaced by solid rods we shall have at once the frame-work of an
Ophiurid (Pluteus) larva. Let us imagine all these
arms to be <span class="xxpn" id="p393">{393}</span>
bent symmetrically downwards, so that the plane of the paper is
transformed into a spheroidal surface, such as that of a hemisphere,
or that of a tall conical figure with curved sides; let a membrane
be spread, umbrella-like, between the outstretched skeletal rods,
and let its margin loop from rod to rod in curves which are possibly
catenaries, but are more probably portions of an “elastic curve,”
and the outward resemblance to a Pluteus larva is now complete.
By various slight modifications, by altering the relative lengths
of the rods, by modifying their curvature or by replacing the curved
rod by a tangent to itself, we can ring the changes which lead us
from one known type of Pluteus to another. The case of the
Bipinnaria larvae of Echinids is certainly analogous, but it becomes</p>

do with a more complex partitioning of space, and I confess
that I am not yet able to represent the more complicated
forms in so simple a way.</p>

<p>There are a few notable exceptions (besides the various unequally
segmenting eggs) to the general rule that in cell-division
the mother-cell tends to divide into equal halves; and one of these
exceptional cases is to be found in connection with the development
of “stomata” in the leaves of plants. The epidermal cells
by which the leaf is covered may be of various shapes; sometimes,
as in a hyacinth, they are oblong, but more often they have an
irregular shape in which we can recognise, more or less clearly,
a distorted or imperfect hexagon. In the case of the oblong cells,
a transverse partition will be the least possible, whether the cell
be equally or unequally divided, unless (as we

stoma. In</p>

<p class="pcontinue">other cases, as in Fig.
<a href="#fig178" title="go to Fig. 178">178</a>, there will come a point where the minimal partition
necessary to cut off the required fraction of the
cell-content is no longer a transverse one, but is a
portion of a cylindrical wall (2) cutting off one corner
of the mother-cell. The cell so cut off is now a certain
segment of a circle, with an arc of ap­prox­i­mate­ly 120°;
and its next division will be by means of a curved wall
cutting it into a triangular and a quadrangular portion
(3). The triangular portion will continue to divide in
a similar way (4, 5), and at length (for a reason which
is not yet clear) the partition wall <span class="xxpn"

and again we have the phenomenon of a “stoma” with its
attendant guard-cells. In Fig. <a href="#fig179" title="go to Fig. 179">179</a> are shewn the successive
stages of division, and the changing curvatures of the
various walls which ensue as each subsequent partition
appears, introducing a new tension into the system.<br

<p>It is obvious that in the case of the oblong cells of the epidermis
in the hyacinth the stomata will be found arranged in regular rows,
while they will be irregularly distributed over the surface of the
leaf in such a case as we have depicted in Sedum.</p>

<p>While, as I have said, the mechanical cause of the split which
constitutes the orifice of the stoma is not quite clear, yet there
can be little or no doubt that it, like the rest of the phenomenon,
is related to surface tension. It might well be that it is directly
due to the presence underneath this portion of epidermis of the
hollow air-space which the stoma is apparently developed “for
the purpose” of communicating with; this air-surface on both
sides of the delicate epidermis might well cause such an alteration
of tensions that the two halves of the dividing cell would tend to
part company. In short, if the surface-energy in a cell-air contact
were half or less than half that in a contact between cell and cell,
then it is obvious that our partition would tend to split, and give
us a two-fold surface in contact with air, instead of the original
boundary or interface between one cell and the other. In Professor
Macallum’s experiments, which we have briefly discussed in our
short chapter on Adsorption, it was found that large quantities
of potassium gathered together along the outer walls of the guard-cells
of the stoma, thereby indicating a low surface-tension along
these outer walls. The tendency of the guard-cells to bulge
outwards is so far explained, and it is possible that, under the
existing conditions of restraint, we may have here a force tending,
or helping, to split the two cells asunder. It is clear enough,
however, that the last stage in the development of a stoma, is,
from the physical point of view, not yet properly understood.</p>

<p>In all our foregoing examples of the development of a “tissue”
we have seen that the process consists in the <i>successive</i> division
of cells, each act of division being accompanied
by the formation <span class="xxpn" id="p396">{396}</span>
of a boundary-surface, which, whether it become at once a solid
or semi-solid partition or whether it remain semi-fluid, exercises
in all cases an effect on the position and the form of the boundary
which comes into being with the next act of division. In contrast
to this general process stands the phenomenon known as “free
cell-formation,” in which, out of a common mass of protoplasm,
a number of separate cells are <i>simultaneously</i>, or all but simultaneously,
differentiated. In a number of cases it happens that,
to begin with, a number of “mother-cells” are formed simultaneously,
and each of these divides, by two successive</p>

These daughter-cells will tend to group
themselves, just as would four soap-bubbles, into a “tetrad,” the
four cells cor­re­spon­ding to the angles of a regular tetrahedron.
For the system of four bodies is evidently here in perfect symmetry;
the partition-walls and their respective edges meet at equal
angles: three walls everywhere meeting in an edge, and the four
edges converging to a point in the geometrical centre of the
system. This is the typical mode of development of pollen-grains,
common among Monocotyledons and all but universal
among Dicotyledonous plants. By a loosening of the surrounding
tissue and an expansion of the cavity, or
anther-cell, in which <span class="xxpn" id="p397">{397}</span>
they lie, the pollen-grains afterwards fall apart, and their individual
form will depend upon whether or no their walls have</p>

<p class="pcontinue">solidified before this liberation takes place.
For if not, then the separate grains will be
free to assume a spherical form as a consequence
of their own individual and unrestricted
growth; but if they become solid
or rigid prior to the separation of the
tetrad, then they will conserve more or less
completely the plane interfaces and sharp
angles of the elements of the tetrahedron.
The latter is the case, for instance, in
the pollen-grains of Epilobium (Fig. <a href="#fig180" title="go to Fig. 180">180</a>, 1) and in many
others. In the Passion-flower (2) we have an intermediate
condition: where we can still see an indication of the facets
where the grains abutted on one another in the tetrad, but
the plane faces have been swollen by growth into spheroidal or
spherical surfaces. It is obvious that there may easily be cases
where the tetrads of daughter-cells are prevented from assuming
the tetrahedral form: cases, that is to say, where the four cells
are forced and crushed into one plane. The figures given by
Goebel of the development of the pollen of Neottia (3, <i>a</i>–<i>e</i>: all
the figures referring to grains taken from a single anther), illustrate
this to perfection; and it will be seen that, when the four cells
lie in a plane, they conform exactly to our typical diagram of the
first four cells in a segmenting ovum. Occasionally, though the
four cells lie in a plane, the diagram seems to fail us, for the cells
appear to meet in a simple cross (as in 5); but here we soon
perceive that the cells are not in complete interfacial contact,
but are kept apart by a little intervening drop of fluid or bubble
of air. The spores of ferns (7) develop in very much the same
way as pollen-grains; and they also very often retain traces of
the shape which they assumed as members of a tetrahedral figure.
Among the “tetraspores” (8) of the Florideae, or Red Seaweeds,
we have a phenomenon which is in every respect analogous.
<br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<p>Here again it is obvious that, apart from differences in actual
magnitude, and apart from superficial or “accidental” differences
(referable to other physical phenomena) in the
way of colour, <span class="xxpn" id="p398">{398}</span>
texture and minute sculpture or pattern, it comes to pass, through
the laws of surface-tension and the principles of the geometry of
position, that a very small number of diagrammatic figures will
sufficiently represent the outward forms of all the tetraspores,
four-celled pollen-grains, and other four-celled aggregates which
are known or are even capable of existence.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>We have been dealing hitherto (save for some slight exceptions)
with the partitioning of cells on the assumption that the system
either remains unaltered in size or else that growth has proceeded
uniformly in all directions. But we extend the scope of our
enquiry very greatly when we begin to deal with <i>unequal growth</i>,
with growth, that is to say, which produces a greater extension
along some one axis than another. And here we come close in
touch with that great and still (as I think) insufficiently appreciated
generalisation of Sachs, that the manner in which the cells divide
is <i>the result</i>, and not the cause, of the form of the dividing
structure: that the form of the mass is caused by its growth
as a whole, and is not a resultant of the growth of the
cells individually considered<a class="afnanch" href="#fn403" id="fnanch403">403</a>.
Such asymmetry of growth
may be easily imagined, and may conceivably arise from a
variety of causes. In any individual cell, for instance, it may
arise from molecular asymmetry of the structure of the cell-wall,
giving it greater rigidity in one direction than another, while all
the while the hydrostatic pressure within the cell remains constant
and uniform. In an aggregate of cells, it may very well arise
from a greater chemical, or osmotic, activity in one than another,
leading to a localised increase in the fluid pressure, and to a
cor­re­spon­ding bulge over a certain area of the external surface.
It might conceivably occur as a direct result of the preceding
cell-divisions, when these are such as to produce many peripheral
or concentric walls in one part and few or none in another, with
the obvious result of strengthening the common boundary wall
and resisting the outward pressure of growth in parts where the
former is the case; that is to say, in our
dividing quadrant, if <span class="xxpn" id="p399">{399}</span>
its quadrangular portion subdivide by periclines, and the triangular
portion by oblique anticlines (as we have seen to be the natural
tendency), then we might expect that external growth would be
more manifest over the latter than over the former areas. As
a direct and immediate consequence of this we might expect a
tendency for special outgrowths, or “buds,” to arise from the
triangular rather than from the quadrangular cells; and this
turns out to be not merely a tendency towards which theoretical
con­si­de­ra­tions point, but a widespread and important factor in the
morphology of the cryptogams. But meanwhile, without enquiring
further into this complicated question, let us simply take
it that, if we start from such a simple case as a round cell which
has divided into two halves, or four quarters (as the case may be),
we shall at once get bilateral symmetry about a main axis, and
other secondary results arising therefrom, as soon as one of the
halves, or one of the quarters, begins to shew a rate of growth in
advance of the others; for the more rapidly growing cell, or the
peripheral wall common to two or more such rapidly growing cells,
will bulge out into an ellipsoid form, and may finally extend
into a cylinder with rounded or ellipsoid end.</p>

<p>This latter very simple case is illustrated in the development
of a pollen-tube, where the rapidly growing cell develops into the
elongated cylindrical tube, and the slow-growing or quiescent part
remains behind as the so-called “vegetative” cell or cells.</p>

<p>Just as we have found it easier to study the segmentation of
a circular disc than that of a spherical cell, so let us begin in the
same way, by enquiring into the divisions which will ensue if the
disc tend to grow, or elongate, in some one particular direction,
instead of in radial symmetry. The figures which we shall then
obtain will not only apply to the disc, but will also represent, in
all essential features, a projection or longitudinal section of a solid
body, spherical to begin with, preserving its symmetry as a solid
of revolution, and subject to the same general laws as we have
studied in the disc<a class="afnanch" href="#fn404" id="fnanch404">404</a>.
<span class="xxpn" id="p400">{400}</span></p>

<ul>
<li><p>(1) Suppose, in the first place, that the axis of growth lies
symmetrically in one of the original quadrantal cells of a segmenting
disc; and let this growing cell elongate with comparative rapidity
before it subdivides. When it does divide, it will necessarily do
so by a transverse partition, concave towards the apex of the
cell: and, as further elongation takes place, the cylindrical
structure which will be developed thereby will tend to be again
and again subdivided by similar concave transverse partitions.
If at any time, through this process of concurrent elongation and
subdivision, the apical cell become equivalent to, or less than,
a hemisphere, it will next divide by means of a longitudinal, or
vertical partition; and similar longitudinal partitions will arise in
the other segments of the cylinder, as soon as it comes about that
their length (in the direction of the axis) is less than their breadth.</p>

<div class="dctr03" id="fig182">
<img src="images/i400.png" width="610" height="397" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 182.</div></div>

<p>But when we think of this structure in the solid, we at once
perceive that each of these flattened segments of the cylinder,
into which our cylinder has divided, is equivalent to a flattened
circular disc; and its further division will accordingly tend to
proceed like any other flattened disc, namely into four quadrants,
and afterwards by anticlines and
periclines in the usual way. <span class="xxpn" id="p401">{401}</span>
A section across the cylinder, then, will tend to shew us precisely
the same arrangements as we have already so fully studied in
connection with the typical division of a circular cell into quadrants,
and of these quadrants into triangular and quadrangular portions,
and so on.</p>

<p>But there are other possibilities to be considered, in regard to
the mode of division of the elongating quasi-cylindrical portion, as
it gradually develops out of the growing and bulging quadrantal
cell; for the manner in which this latter cell divides will simply
depend upon the form it has assumed before each successive act
of division takes place, that is to say upon the ratio between its
rate of growth and the frequency of its successive divisions. For,
as we have already seen, if the growing cell attain a markedly
oblong or cylindrical form before division ensues, then the partition
will arise transversely to the long axis; if it be but a little more
than a hemisphere, it will divide by an oblique partition; and if
it be less than a hemisphere (as it may come to be after successive
transverse divisions) it will divide by a vertical partition, that is
to say by one coinciding with its axis of growth. An immense
number of permutations and combinations may arise in this way,
and we must confine our illustrations to a small number of cases.
The important thing is not so much to trace out the various
conformations which may arise, but to grasp the fundamental
principle: which is, that the forces which dominate the <i>form</i> of
each cell regulate the manner of its subdivision, that is to say
the form of the new cells into which it subdivides; or in other
words, the form of the growing organism regulates the form and
number of the cells which eventually constitute it. The complex
cell-network is not the cause but the result of the general configuration,
which latter has its essential cause in whatsoever physical
and chemical processes have led to a varying velocity of growth
in one direction as compared with another.</p>

 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 183. Development of

<p>In the annexed figure of an embryo of Sphagnum we see a
mode of development almost precisely cor­re­spon­ding to the
hypothetical case which we have just described,—the case, that
is to say, where one of the four original quadrants of the mother-cell
is the chief agent in future growth and development. We
see at the base of our first figure (<i>a</i>), the
three stationary, or <span class="xxpn" id="p402">{402}</span>
undivided quadrants, one of which has further slowly divided
in the stage <i>b</i>. The active quadrant
has grown quickly into a cylindrical
structure, which inevitably divides, in
the next place, into a series of transverse
partitions; and accordingly, this
mode of development carries with it
the presence of a single “apical cell,”
whose lower wall is a spherical surface
with its convexity downwards. Each
cell of the subdivided cylinder now appears
as a more or less flattened disc,
whose mode of further sub-division
we may prognosticate according to
our former in­ves­ti­ga­tion, to which
subject we shall presently return.<br class="brclrfix" /></p></li>

<img src="images/i402b.png" width="608" height="382" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 184.</div></div>

<p>(2) In the next place, still keeping to the case where only one
of the original quadrant-cells continues to grow and develop, let
us suppose that this growing cell falls to be divided when by
growth it has become just a little greater than a hemisphere; it
will then divide, as in Fig. <a href="#fig184" title="go to Fig. 184">184</a>, 2, by an oblique partition, in the
usual way, whose precise position and inclination to the base will
depend entirely on the configuration of the cell itself, save only,
of course, that we may have also to take into account the possibility
of the division being into two unequal halves.
By our hypothesis, <span class="xxpn" id="p403">{403}</span>
the growth of the whole system is mainly in a vertical direction,
which is as much as to say that the more actively growing protoplasm,
or at least the strongest osmotic force, will be found
near the apex; where indeed there is obviously more external
surface for osmotic action. It will therefore be that one of
the two cells which contains, or constitutes, the apex which
will grow more rapidly than the other, and which therefore will
be the first to divide, and indeed in any case, it will usually be
this one of the two which will tend to divide first, inasmuch
as the triangular and not the quadrangular half is bound to
constitute the apex<a class="afnanch" href="#fn405" id="fnanch405">405</a>.
It is obvious that (unless the act of division
be so long postponed that the cell has become quasi-cylindrical)
it will divide by another oblique partition, starting from, and
running at right angles to, the first. And so division will proceed,</p>

<p class="pcontinue">by oblique alternate partitions, each one tending to
be, at first, perpendicular to that on which it is based
and also to the peripheral wall; but all these points of
contact soon tending, by reason of the equal tensions
of the three films or surfaces which meet there, to form
angles of 120°. There will always be, in such a case,
a single apical cell, of a more or less distinctly
triangular form. The annexed figure of the developing
antheridium of a Liverwort (Riccia) is a typical example
of such a case. In Fig. <a href="#fig185" title="go to Fig. 185">185</a> which represents a
“gemma” of a Moss, we see just the same thing;
with this addition, that here the lower of the two
original cells has grown even more quickly than the
other, constituting a long cylindrical stalk, and dividing in accordance
with its shape, by means of transverse septa.
<br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<p>In all such cases as these, the cells whose development we have
studied will in turn tend to subdivide, and the manner in which
they will do so must depend upon their own proportions; and in
all cases, as we have already seen, there will sooner or later be
a tendency to the formation of periclinal walls, cutting off an
“epidermal layer of cells,” as Fig. <a href="#fig186" title="go to Fig. 186">186</a> illustrates very well.</p>

<p>The method of division by means of oblique partitions is a
common one in the case of ‘growing points’;
for it evidently <span class="xxpn" id="p404">{404}</span>
includes all cases in which the act of cell-division does not lag
far behind that elongation which is determined by the specific rate
of growth. And it is also obvious that, under a common type,
there must here be included a variety of cases which will, at first
sight, present a very different appearance one from another.
For instance, in Fig. <a href="#fig187" title="go to Fig. 187">187</a> which represents a growing shoot of
Selaginella, and somewhat less dia­gram­ma­ti­cally in the young
embryo of Jungermannia (Fig. <a href="#fig188" title="go to Fig. 188">188</a>), we have the appearance of
an almost straight vertical partition running up in the axis of the
system, and the primary cell-walls are set almost at right angles
to it,—almost transversely, that is to say to the outer walls and
to the long axis of the structure. We
soon recognise, however, <span class="xxpn" id="p405">{405}</span>
that the difference is merely a difference of degree. The more
remote the partitions are, that is to say the greater the velocity
of growth relatively to division, the less abrupt will be the
alternate kinks or curvatures of the portions which lie in the
neighbourhood of the axis, and the more will these portions
appear to constitute a single unbroken wall.</p></li>

<li>
<div class="dctr01" id="fig189">
<img src="images/i405.png" width="791" height="238" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 189.</div></div>

<p>(3) But an appearance nearly, if not quite, in­dis­tin­guish­able
from this may be got in another way, namely, when the original
growing cell is so nearly hemispherical that it is actually divided
by a vertical partition, into two quadrants; and from this vertical
partition, as it elongates, lateral partition-walls will arise on either
side. And by the tensions exercised by these, the vertical partition
will be bent into little portions set at 120° one to another, and the
whole will come to look just like that which, in the former case,
was made up of portions of many successive oblique partitions.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Let us now, in one or two cases, follow out a little further the
stages of cell-division whose beginning we have studied in the last
paragraphs. In the antheridium of Riccia, after the successive
oblique partitions have produced the longitudinal series of cells
shewn in Fig. <a href="#fig186" title="go to Fig. 186">186</a>, it is plain that the next partitions will arise
periclinally, that is to say parallel to the outer wall, which in
this particular case represents the short axis of the oblong cells.
The effect is at once to produce an epidermal layer, whose cells
will tend to subdivide further by means of partitions perpendicular
to the free surface, that is to say crossing the flattened cells by
their shortest diameter. The inner mass, beneath the epidermis,
consists of cells which are still more or less oblong,
or which become <span class="xxpn" id="p406">{406}</span>
definitely so in process of growth; and these again divide, parallel
to their short axes, into squarish cells, which as usual, by the
mutual tension of their walls, become hexagonal, as seen in a plane
section. There is a clear distinction, then, in form as well as in
position, between the outer covering-cells and those which lie
within this envelope; the latter are reduced to a condition which
merely fulfils the mechanical function of a protective coat, while
the former undergo less modification, and give rise to the actively
living, reproductive elements.</p>

 <div class="pcaption">Fig. 190. Development of sporangium of

<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig190" title="go to Fig. 190">190</a> is shewn the development of the sporangium of a
fern (Osmunda). We may trace here the common phenomenon
of a series of oblique partitions, built alternately on one another,
and cutting off a conspicuous triangular apical cell. Over the
whole system an epidermal layer has been formed, in the manner
we have described; and in this case it covers the apical cell also,
owing to the fact that it was of such dimensions that, at one stage
of growth, a periclinal partition wall, cutting off its outer end,
was indicated as of less area than an anticlinal one. This periclinal
wall cuts down the apical cell to the proportions, very nearly,
of an equilateral triangle, but the solid form of the cell is obviously
that of a tetrahedron with curved faces; and accordingly, the
least possible partitions by which further subdivision can be
effected will run successively parallel to its four sides (or its three
sides when we confine ourselves to the appearances
as seen in <span class="xxpn" id="p407">{407}</span>
section). The effect, as seen in section, is to cut off on each side
a char­ac­teris­ti­cally flattened cell, oblong as seen in section, still
leaving a triangular (or strictly speaking, a tetrahedral) one in
the centre. The former cells, which constitute no specific structure
or perform no specific physiological function, but which merely
represent certain directions in space towards which the whole
system of partitioning has gradually led, are called by botanists
the “tapetum.” The active growing tetrahedral cell which lies
between them, and from which in a sense every other cell in the
system has been either directly or indirectly segmented off, still
manifests, as it were, its vigour and activity, and now, by
internal subdivision, becomes the mother-cell of the spores.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>In all these cases, for simplicity’s sake, we have merely considered
the appearances presented in a single, longitudinal, plane
of optical section. But it is not difficult to interpret from these
appearances what would be seen in another plane, for instance
in a transverse section. In our first example, for instance, that
of the developing embryo of Sphagnum (Fig. <a href="#fig183" title="go to Fig. 183">183</a>), we can see that,
at appropriate levels, the cells of the original cylindrical row have
divided into transverse rows of four, and then of eight cells. We
may be sure that the four cells represent, ap­prox­i­mate­ly, quadrants
of a cylindrical disc, the four cells, as usual, not meeting in a point,
but intercepted by a small intermediate partition. Again, where
we have a plate of eight cells, we may well imagine that the eight
octants are arranged in what we have found to be the way
naturally resulting from the division of four quadrants, that is to
say into alternately triangular and quadrangular portions; and
this is found by means of sections to be the case. The accompanying
figure is precisely comparable to our previous diagrams of the
arrangement of an aggregate of eight cells in a dividing disc, save
only that, in two cases, the cells have already undergone a further
subdivision.</p>

<p>It follows in like manner, that in a host of cases we meet with
this char­ac­ter­is­tic figure, in one or other of its possible, and
strictly limited, variations,—in the cross sections of growing
embryonic structures, just as we have already seen that it appears
in a host of cases where the entire system (or a
portion of its <span class="xxpn" id="p408">{408}</span>
surface) consists of eight cells only. For example, in Fig. <a href="#fig191" title="go to Fig. 191">191</a>,</p>

<p class="pcontinue">Fig. <a href="#fig192" title="go to Fig. 192">192</a> shewing a section through a
growing frond of a sea-weed (Girardia) we have a case where
the partitions forming the eight octants have conformed
to the usual type; but instead of the usual division by
periclines of the four quadrangular spaces, these latter
are dividing by means of oblique septa, apparently owing
to the fact that the cell is not dividing into two equal,
but into two unequal portions. In this last figure we
have a peculiar look of stiffness or formality, such that
it appears at first to bear little resemblance to the
rest. The explanation is of the simplest. The mode of
partitioning differs little (except to some slight extent
in the way already mentioned) from the normal type; but in
this case the partition walls are so thick and become so
quickly comparatively solid and rigid, that the secondary
curvatures due to their successive mutual tractions are
here imperceptible.

the development of the antheridium
of a fern, as described by Strasbürger.
Here the antheridium develops from
a single cell, whose form has grown
to be something more than a hemisphere;
and the first partition, instead
of stretching transversely across the
cell, as we should expect it to do if
the cell were actually spherical, has
as it were sagged down to come in
contact with the base, and so to develop
into an annular partition, running
round the lower margin of the cell. The phenomenon is akin to that
cutting off of the corner of a cubical cell by a spherical partition,
of which we have spoken on p. <a href="#p349" title="go to pg. 349">349</a>, and the annular film is very
easy to reproduce by means of a soap-bubble in the bottom of
a cylindrical dish or beaker. The next partition is a periclinal
one, concentric with the outer surface of the young antheridium;
and this in turn is followed by a concave partition which cuts off
the apex of the original cell: but which becomes connected with
the second, or periclinal partition in precisely the same annular
fashion as the first partition did with the base of the little
antheridium. The result is that, at this stage, we have four
cell-cavities in the little antheridium: (1) a central cavity;
(2) an annular space around the lower margin; (3) a narrow annular
or cylindrical space around the sides of the antheridium; and
(4) a small terminal or apical cell. It is evident that the tendency,
in the next place, will be to subdivide the flattened external cells
by means of anticlinal partitions, and so to convert the whole
structure into a single layer of epidermal cells, surrounding a
central cell within which, in course of time, the antherozoids are
developed. <br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<p>The foregoing account deals only with a few elementary phenomena,
and may seem to fall far short of an attempt to deal in general
with “the forms of tissues.” But it is the principle involved,
and not its ultimate and very complex results, that
we can alone <span class="xxpn" id="p410">{410}</span>
attempt to grapple with. The stock-in-trade of math­e­mat­i­cal
physics, in all the subjects with which that science deals, is for the
most part made up of simple, or simplified, cases of phenomena
which in their actual and concrete manifestations are usually too
complex for math­e­mat­i­cal analysis; and when we attempt to
apply its methods to our biological and histological phenomena,
in a preliminary and elementary way, we need not wonder if we
be limited to illustrations which are obviously of a simple kind,
and which cover but a small part of the phenomena with which
the histologist has become familiar. But it is only relatively that
these phenomena to which we have found the method applicable
are to be deemed simple and few. They go already far beyond
the simplest phenomena of all, such as we see in the dividing
Protococcus, and in the first stages, two-celled or four-celled, of
the segmenting egg. They carry us into stages where the cells
are already numerous, and where the whole conformation has
become by no means easy to depict or visualise, without the help
and guidance which the phenomena of surface-tension, the laws
of equi­lib­rium and the principle of minimal areas are at hand
to supply. And so far as we have gone, and so far as we can
discern, we see no sign of the guiding principles failing us, or of
the simple laws ceasing
to hold good.</p>

 and Spicular Skeletons.">CHAPTER IX
 <span class="h2ttl">
 ON CONCRETIONS, SPICULES, AND SPICULAR
 SKELETONS</span></h2></div>

<p>The deposition of inorganic material in the living body, usually
in the form of calcium salts or of silica, is a very common and
wide-spread phenomenon. It begins in simple ways, by the
appearance of small isolated particles, crystalline or non-crystalline,
whose form has little relation or sometimes none to
the structure of the organism; it culminates in the complex
skeletons of the vertebrate animals, in the massive skeletons of
the corals, or in the polished, sculptured and math­e­mat­i­cally
regular molluscan shells. Even among many very simple organisms,
such as the Diatoms, the Radiolarians, the Foraminifera,
or the Sponges, the skeleton displays extraordinary variety and
beauty, whether by reason of the intrinsic form of its elementary
constituents or the geometric symmetry with which these are
arranged and interconnected.</p>

<p>With regard to the form of these various structures (and this
is all that immediately concerns us here), it is plain that we have
to do with two distinct problems, which however, though
theoretically distinct, may merge with one another. For the
form of the spicule or other skeletal element may depend simply
upon its chemical nature, as for instance, to take a simple but
not the only case, when the form is purely crystalline; or the
inorganic solid material may be laid down in conformity with the
shapes assumed by the cells, tissues or organs, and so be, as it
were, moulded to the shape of the living organism; and again,
there may well be intermediate stages in which both phenomena
may be simultaneously recognised, the molecular forces playing
their part in conjunction with, and under the restraint of, the
other forces inherent
in the system. <span class="xxpn" id="p412">{412}</span></p>

<p>So far as the problem is a purely chemical one, we must deal
with it very briefly indeed; and all the more because special
investigations regarding it have as yet been few, and even the
main facts of the case are very imperfectly known. This at least
is evident, that the whole series of phenomena with which we are
about to deal go deep into the subject of colloid chemistry, and
especially with that branch of the science which deals with the
properties of colloids in connection with capillary or surface
phenomena. It is to the special student of colloid chemistry that
we must ultimately and chiefly look for the elucidation of our
problem<a class="afnanch" href="#fn406" id="fnanch406">406</a>.</p>

<p>In the first and simplest part of our subject, the essential
problem is the problem of cry­stal­li­sa­tion in presence of colloids.
In the cells of plants, true crystals are found in comparative
abundance, and they consist, in the great majority of cases, of
calcium oxalate. In the stem and root of the rhubarb, for instance,
in the leaf-stalk of Begonia, and in countless other cases, sometimes
within the cell, sometimes in the substance of the cell-wall, we
find large and well-formed crystals of this salt; their varieties of
form, which are extremely numerous, are simply the crystalline
forms proper to the salt itself, and belong to the two systems,
cubic and monoclinic, in one or other of which, according to
the amount of water of cry­stal­li­sa­tion, this salt is known to
crystallise. When calcium oxalate crystallises according to the
latter system (as it does when its molecule is combined with two
molecules of water of cry­stal­li­sa­tion), the microscopic crystals
have the form of fine needles, or “raphides,” such as are very
common in plants; and it has been found that these are artificially
produced when the salt is crystallised out in presence of glucose
or of dextrin<a class="afnanch" href="#fn407" id="fnanch407">407</a>.</p>

<div class="dctr01" id="fig194">
<img src="images/i413.png" width="800" height="594" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 194. Alcyonarian spicules: <i>Siphonogorgia</i>
and <i>Anthogorgia</i>. (After Studer.)</div></div>

<p>Calcium carbonate, on the other hand, when it occurs in plant-cells
(as it does abundantly, for instance in the “cystoliths” of the
Urticaceae and Acanthaceae, and in great
quantities in Melobesia <span class="xxpn" id="p413">{413}</span>
and the other calcareous or “stony” algae), appears in the form
of fine rounded granules, whose inherent crystalline structure
is not outwardly visible, but is only revealed (like that of a
molluscan shell) under polarised light. Among animals, a skeleton
of carbonate of lime occurs under a multitude of forms, of which
we need only mention now a very few of the most conspicuous.
The spicules of the calcareous sponges are triradiate, occasionally
quadriradiate, bodies, with pointed rays, not crystalline in outward
form but with a definitely crystalline internal structure. We shall
return again to these, and find for them what would seem to be
a satisfactory explanation of their form. Among the Alcyonarian
zoophytes we have a great variety of spicules<a class="afnanch" href="#fn408" id="fnanch408">408</a>,
which are sometimes
straight and slender rods, sometimes flattened and more or
less striated plates, and still more often rounded or branched
concretions with rough or knobby surfaces (Figs. <a href="#fig194" title="go to Fig. 194">194</a>, 200). A
third type, presented by several very different things, such as
a pearl, or the ear-bone of a bony fish, consists
of a more or less <span class="xxpn" id="p414">{414}</span>
rounded body, sometimes spherical, sometimes flattened, in which
the calcareous matter is laid down in concentric zones, denser
and clearer layers alternating with one another. In the development
of the molluscan shell and in the calcification of a bird’s
egg or the shell of a crab, for instance, spheroidal bodies with
similar concentric striation make their appearance; but instead of
remaining separate they become crowded together, and as they
coalesce they combine to form a pattern of hexagons. In some
cases, the carbonate of lime on being dissolved away by acid
leaves behind it a certain small amount of organic residue; in
most cases other salts, such as phosphates of lime, ammonia or
magnesia are present in small quantities; and in most cases if
not all the developing spicule or concretion is somehow or other
so associated with living cells that we are apt to take it for granted
that it owes its peculiarities of form to the constructive or plastic
agency of these.</p>

<p>The appearance of direct association with living cells, however,
is apt to be fallacious; for the actual <i>precipitation</i> takes place,
as a rule, not in actively living, but in dead or at least inactive
tissue<a class="afnanch" href="#fn409" id="fnanch409">409</a>:
that is to say in the “formed material” or matrix which
(as for instance in cartilage) accumulates round the living cells,
in the interspaces between these latter, or at least, as often happens,
in connection with the cell-wall or cell-membrane rather than
within the substance of the protoplasm itself. We need not go
the length of asserting that this is a rule without exception; but,
so far as it goes, it is of great importance and to its consideration
we shall presently return<a class="afnanch" href="#fn410" id="fnanch410">410</a>.</p>

<p>Cognate with this is the fact that it is known, at least in some
cases, that the organism can go on living and multiplying with
apparently unimpaired health, when stinted or even wholly
deprived of the material of which it is wont to
make its spicules <span class="xxpn" id="p415">{415}</span>
or its shell. Thus, Pouchet and Chabry<a class="afnanch" href="#fn411" id="fnanch411">411</a>
have shown that the
eggs of sea-urchins reared in lime-free water develop in apparent
health, into larvae entirely destitute of the usual skeleton of
calcareous rods, and in which, accordingly, the long arms of the
Pluteus larva, which the rods support and distend, are entirely
suppressed. And again, when Foraminifera are kept for generations
in water from which they gradually exhaust the lime, their
shells grow hyaline and transparent, and seem to consist only of
chitinous material. On the other hand, in the presence of excess
of lime, the shells become much altered, strengthened with various
“ornaments,” and assuming characters described as proper to
other varieties and even species<a class="afnanch" href="#fn412" id="fnanch412">412</a>.</p>

<p>The crucial experiment, then, is to attempt the formation of
similar structures or forms, apart from the living organism: but,
however feasible the attempt may be in theory, we shall be prepared
from the first to encounter difficulties, and to realise that, though
the actions involved may be wholly within the range of chemistry
and physics, yet the actual conditions of the case may be so
complex, subtle and delicate, that only now and then, and in the
simplest of cases, shall we find ourselves in a position to imitate
them completely and successfully. Such an in­ves­ti­ga­tion is only
part of that much wider field of enquiry through which Stephane
Leduc and many other workers<a class="afnanch" href="#fn413" id="fnanch413">413</a>
have sought to produce, by
synthetic means, forms similar to those of living things; but it
is a well-defined and circumscribed part of that wider in­ves­ti­ga­tion.
When by chemical or physical experiment we obtain con­fi­gur­a­tions
similar, for instance, to the phenomena of nuclear division, or
conformations similar to a pattern of hexagonal cells, or a group
of vesicles which resemble some particular tissue or cell-aggregate,
we indeed prove what it is the main object of this book to illustrate,
namely, that the physical forces are capable of producing particular
organic forms. But it is by no means always that we can feel
perfectly assured that the physical forces which we deal with in
our experiment are identical with, and not
merely analogous to, <span class="xxpn" id="p416">{416}</span>
the physical forces which, at work in nature, are bringing about
the result which we have succeeded in imitating. In the present
case, however, our enquiry is restricted and apparently simplified;
we are seeking in the first instance to obtain by purely chemical
means a purely chemical result, and there is little room for
ambiguity in our interpretation of the experiment.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>When we find ourselves investigating the forms assumed by
chemical compounds under the peculiar circumstances of association
with a living body, and when we find these forms to be
char­ac­ter­is­tic or recognisable, and somehow different from those
which, under other circumstances, the same substance is wont
to assume, an analogy presents itself to our minds, captivating
though perhaps somewhat remote, between this subject of ours
and certain synthetic problems of the organic chemist. There is
doubtless an essential difference, as well as a difference of scale,
between the visible form of a spicule or concretion and the hypothetical
form of an individual molecule; but molecular form is
a very important concept; and the chemist has not only succeeded,
since the days of Wöhler, in synthesising many substances which
are char­ac­teris­ti­cally associated with living matter, but his task
has included the attempt to account for the molecular <i>forms</i> of
certain “asymmetric” substances, glucose, malic acid and many
more, as they occur in nature. These are bodies which, when
artificially synthesised, have no optical activity, but which, as we
actually find them in organisms, turn (when <i>in solution</i>) the plane
of polarised light in one direction or the other; thus dextro-glucose
and laevomalic acid are common products of plant
metabolism; but dextromalic acid and laevo-glucose do not occur
in nature at all. The optical activity of these bodies depends,
as Pasteur shewed more than fifty years ago<a class="afnanch" href="#fn414" id="fnanch414">414</a>,
upon the form,
right-handed or left-handed, of their molecules, which molecular
asymmetry further gives rise to a cor­re­spon­ding right or left-handedness
(or enantiomorphism) in the crystalline aggregates.
It is a distinct problem in organic or
physiological chemistry, <span class="xxpn" id="p417">{417}</span>
and by no means without its interest for the morphologist, to
discover how it is that nature, for each particular substance,
habitually builds up, or at least selects, its molecules in a one-sided
fashion, right-handed or left-handed as the case may be.
It will serve us no better to assert that this phenomenon has its
origin in “fortuity,” than to repeat the Abbé Galiani’s saying,
“<i>les dés de la nature sont pipés.</i>”</p>

<p>The problem is not so closely related to our immediate subject
that we need discuss it at length; but at the same time it has its
clear relation to the general question of <i>form</i> in relation to vital
phenomena, and moreover it has acquired interest as a theme
of long-continued discussion and new importance from some
comparatively recent discoveries.</p>

<p>According to Pasteur, there lay in the molecular asymmetry
of the natural bodies and the symmetry of the artificial products,
one of the most deep-seated differences between vital and non-vital
phenomena: he went further, and declared that “this was
perhaps the <i>only</i> well-marked line of demarcation that can at
present [1860] be drawn between the chemistry of dead and of
living matter.” Nearly forty years afterwards the same theme
was pursued and elaborated by Japp in a celebrated lecture<a class="afnanch" href="#fn415" id="fnanch415">415</a>,
and the distinction still has its weight, I believe, in the minds of
many if not most chemists.</p>

<p>“We arrive at the conclusion,” said Professor Japp, “that the
production of single asymmetric compounds, or their isolation
from the mixture of their enantiomorphs, is, as Pasteur firmly
held, the prerogative of life. Only the living organism, or the
living intelligence with its conception of asymmetry, can produce
this result. Only asymmetry can beget asymmetry.” In these
last words (which, so far as the chemist and the biologist are
concerned, we may acknowledge to be
perfectly true<a class="afnanch" href="#fn416" id="fnanch416">416</a>)
lies the <span class="xxpn" id="p418">{418}</span>
crux of the difficulty; for they at once bid us enquire whether in
nature, external to and antecedent to life, there be not some
asymmetry to which we may refer the further propagation or
“begetting” of the new asymmetries: or whether in default
thereof, we be rigorously confined to the conclusion, from which
Japp “saw no escape,” that “at the moment when life first arose,
a directive force came into play,—a force of precisely the same
character as that which enables the intelligent operator, by the
exercise of his will, to select one crystallised enantiomorph and
reject its asymmetric opposite<a class="afnanch" href="#fn417" id="fnanch417">417</a>.”</p>

<p>Observe that it is only the first beginnings of chemical
asymmetry that we need to discover; for when asymmetry is once
manifested, it is not disputed that it will continue “to beget
asymmetry.” A plausible suggestion is now at hand, which if it
be confirmed and extended will supply or at least sufficiently
illustrate the kind of explanation which is required<a class="afnanch" href="#fn418" id="fnanch418">418</a>.</p>

<p>We know in the first place that in cases where ordinary non-polarised
light acts upon a chemical substance, the amount of
chemical action is proportionate to the amount of light absorbed.
We know in the second place<a class="afnanch" href="#fn419" id="fnanch419">419</a>,
in certain cases, that light circularly
polarised is absorbed in different amounts by the right-handed or
left-handed varieties, as the case may be, of an asymmetric
substance. And thirdly, we know that a portion of the light
which comes to us from the sun is already plane-polarised light,
which becomes in part circularly polarised, by reflection (according
to Jamin) at the surface of the sea, and then rotated in a
particular direction under the influence of terrestrial magnetism.
We only require to be assured that the relation between absorption
of light and chemical activity will continue to hold
good in the case of circularly polarised
light; that is to say <span class="xxpn" id="p419">{419}</span>
that the formation of some new substance or other, under the
influence of light so polarised, will proceed asymmetrically in
consonance with the asymmetry of the light itself; or conversely,
that the asymmetrically polarised light will tend to more rapid
decomposition of those molecules by which it is chiefly absorbed.
This latter proof is now said to be furnished by Byk<a class="afnanch" href="#fn420" id="fnanch420">420</a>,
who asserts
that certain tartrates become unsymmetrical under the continued
influence of the asymmetric rays. Here then we seem to have
an example, of a particular kind and in a particular instance, an
example limited but yet crucial (<i>if confirmed</i>), of an asymmetric
force, non-vital in its origin, which might conceivably be the
starting-point of that asymmetry which is char­ac­ter­is­tic of so
many organic products.</p>

<p>The mysteries of organic chemistry are great, and the differences
between its processes or reactions as they are carried out in the
organism and in the laboratory are many<a class="afnanch" href="#fn421" id="fnanch421">421</a>.
The actions, catalytic
and other, which go on in the living cell are of extraordinary
complexity. But the contention that they are different in kind
from what we term ordinary chemical operations, or that in the
production of single asymmetric compounds there is actually to
be witnessed, as Pasteur maintained, a “prerogative of life,”
would seem to be no longer safely tenable. And furthermore, it
behoves us to remember that, even though failure continued to
attend all artificial attempts to originate the asymmetric or
optically active compounds which organic nature produces in
abundance, this would only prove that a certain <i>physical force</i>, or
mode of <i>physical action</i>, is at work among living things though
unknown elsewhere. It is a mode of action which we can easily
imagine, though the actual mechanism we cannot set agoing when
we please. And it follows that such a difference between living
matter and dead would carry us but a little way, for it would still
be confined strictly to the physical or mechanical plane.</p>

<p>Our historic interest in the whole question is
increased by the <span class="xxpn" id="p420">{420}</span>
fact, or the great probability, that “the tenacity with which
Pasteur fought against the doctrine of spontaneous generation was
not unconnected with his belief that chemical compounds of one-sided
symmetry could not arise save under the influence of life<a class="afnanch" href="#fn422" id="fnanch422">422</a>.”
But the question whether spontaneous generation be a fact or not
does not depend upon theoretical con­si­de­ra­tions; our negative
response is based, and is so far soundly based, on repeated failures
to demonstrate its occurrence. Many a great law of physical
science, not excepting gravitation itself, has no higher claim on
our acceptance.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Let us return then, after this digression, to the general subject
of the forms assumed by certain chemical bodies when deposited
or precipitated within the organism, and to the question of how
far these forms may be artificially imitated or theoretically
explained.</p>

<p>Mr George Rainey, of St Bartholomew’s Hospital (to whom
we have already referred), and Professor P. Harting, of Utrecht,
were the first to deal with this specific problem. Mr Rainey
published, between 1857 and 1861, a series of valuable and
thoughtful papers to shew that shell and bone and certain other
organic structures were formed “by a process of molecular
coalescence, demonstrable in certain artificially-formed products<a class="afnanch" href="#fn423" id="fnanch423">423</a>.”
Professor Harting, after thirty years of experimental work,
published in 1872 a paper, which has become classical, entitled
<i>Recherches de Morphologie Synthétique, sur la production artificielle
de quelques formations calcaires organiques</i>; his aim was to pave
the way for a “morphologie synthétique,” as Wöhler had laid the
foundations of a “chimie synthétique,” by his classical discovery
forty years before. <span class="xxpn" id="p421">{421}</span></p>

<p>Rainey and Harting used similar methods, and these were
such as many other workers have continued to employ,—partly
with the direct object of explaining the genesis of organic forms
and partly as an integral part of what is now known as Colloid
Chemistry. The whole gist of the method was to bring some soluble
salt of lime, such as the chloride or nitrate, into solution within a
colloid medium, such as gum, gelatine or albumin; and then to
precipitate it out in the form of some insoluble compound, such
as the carbonate or oxalate. Harting found that, when he added
a little sodium or potassium carbonate to a concentrated solution
of calcium chloride in albumin, he got at first a gelatinous mass,
or “colloid precipitate”: which slowly transformed by the</p>

appearance of tiny microscopic particles, at first motionless, but
afterwards as they grew larger shewing the typical Brownian

whether the solution were albuminous or not, and similar
appearances indeed had been witnessed and recorded by Gustav
Rose, so far back as 1837<a class="afnanch" href="#fn424" id="fnanch424">424</a>;
but in the later stages the presence
of albuminoid matter made a great difference. Now, after a few
days, the calcium carbonate was seen to be deposited in the form
of large rounded concretions, with a more or less distinct central
nucleus, and with a surrounding structure at
once radiate and <span class="xxpn" id="p422">{422}</span>

<p>When the albumin was somewhat scanty, or when it was mixed

of polypes, a vast number of separate “species” have been
based by systematic zoologists. But it is now admitted that
even in specimens of a single species, from one and the same
locality, the spicules may vary immensely in shape and size:
and Professor Hickson declares (in a paper published while
these sheets are passing through the press) that after many
years of laborious work in striving to determine species of
these animal colonies, he feels “quite convinced that we have
been engaged in a more or less fruitless task<a class="afnanch"
href="#fn428" id="fnanch428">428</a>”.</p>

<p>The formation of a tooth has very lately been shown
to be a phenomenon of the same order. That is to say,
“calcification in both dentine and enamel <span class="xxpn"
id="p425">{425}</span> is in great part a physical
phenomenon; the actual deposit in both tissues occurs in
the form of cal­co­sphe­rites, and the process in mammalian
tissue is identical in every point with the same process
occurring in lower organisms<a class="afnanch" href="#fn429"
id="fnanch429">429</a>.” The ossification of bone, we may be
sure, is in the same sense and to the same extent a physical
phenomenon.</p>

elasmobranch fishes, like those of reptiles and birds, are not
developed after this fashion, but are true crystals of calc-spar.)</p>

manifest. It is by surface-tension that ultra-microscopic particles
are brought together in the first floccular precipitate or coagulum;</p>

<p class="pcontinue"> by the same agency, the coarser
particles are in turn agglutinated into visible lumps;
and the form of the cal­co­sphe­rites, whether it be that of
the solitary spheres or that assumed in various stages of
aggregation (e.g. Fig. <a href="#fig202" title="go to Fig. 202">202</a>)<a class="afnanch" href="#fn430"
id="fnanch430">430</a>, is likewise due to the same
agency.</p>

<p>From the point of view of colloid chemistry the whole phenomenon
is very important and significant; and not the least
significant part is this tendency of the solidified deposits to assume
the form of “spherulites,” and other rounded contours. In the
phraseology of that science, we are dealing with a <i>two-phase</i>
system, which finally consists of solid particles in suspension in
a liquid (the former being styled the <i>disperse
phase</i>, the latter the <span class="xxpn" id="p426">{426}</span>
<i>dispersion medium</i>). In accordance with a rule first recognised
by Ostwald<a class="afnanch" href="#fn431" id="fnanch431">431</a>,
when a substance begins to separate out from a
solution, so making its appearance as a <i>new phase</i>, it always
makes its appearance first as a liquid<a class="afnanch" href="#fn432" id="fnanch432">432</a>.
Here is a case in point.
The minute quantities of material, on their way from a state of
solution to a state of “suspension,” pass through a liquid to a
solid form; and their temporary sojourn in the former leaves its
impress in the rounded contours which surface-tension brought
about while the little aggregate was still labile or fluid: while
coincidently with this surface-tension effect upon the surface,
cry­stal­li­sa­tion tended to take place throughout the little liquid
mass, or in such portion of it as had not yet consolidated and
crystallised.</p>

<p>Where we have simple aggregates of two or three cal­co­sphe­rites,
the resulting figure is precisely that of so many contiguous soap-bubbles.
In other cases, composite forms result which are not
so easily explained, but which, if we could only account for them,
would be of very great interest to the biologist. For instance,
when smaller calcospheres seem, as it were, to invade the substance
of a larger one, we get curious conformations which in the closest
possible way resemble the outlines of certain of the Diatoms
(Fig. <a href="#fig203" title="go to Fig. 203">203</a>). Another very curious formation, which Harting calls
a “conostat,” is of frequent occurrence, and in it we see at least
a suggestion of analogy with the configuration which, in a protoplasmic
structure, we have spoken of as a
“collar-cell.” The <span class="xxpn" id="p427">{427}</span>
conostats, which are formed in the surface layer of the solution,
consist of a portion of a spheroidal calcospherite, whose upper
part is continued into a thin spheroidal collar, of somewhat larger
radius than the solid sphere; but the precise manner in which
the collar is formed, possibly around a bubble of gas, possibly
about a vortex-like diffusion-current<a class="afnanch" href="#fn433" id="fnanch433">433</a>
is not obvious.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Among these various phenomena, the concentric striation
observed in the calcospherite has acquired a special interest and
importance<a class="afnanch" href="#fn434" id="fnanch434">434</a>.
It is part of a phenomenon now widely known, and
recognised as an important factor in colloid chemistry, under the
name of “Liesegang’s Rings<a class="afnanch" href="#fn435" id="fnanch435">435</a>.”</p>

<p>If we dissolve, for instance, a little bichromate of potash in
gelatine, pour it on to a glass plate, and after it is set place upon
it a drop of silver nitrate solution, there appears in the course
of a few hours the phenomenon of Liesegang’s rings. At first the
silver forms a central patch of abundant reddish brown chromate
precipitate; but around this, as the silver nitrate diffuses slowly
through the gelatine, the precipitate no longer comes down in
a continuous, uniform layer, but forms a series of zones, beautifully
regular, which alternate with clear interspaces of jelly, and which
stand farther and farther apart, in logarithmic ratio, as they
recede from the centre. For a discussion of
the <i>raison d’être</i> of <span class="xxpn" id="p428">{428}</span>
this phenomenon, still somewhat problematic, the student must
consult the text-books of physical and colloid chemistry<a class="afnanch" href="#fn436" id="fnanch436">436</a>.</p>

<p>But, speaking very generally, we may say the appearance of
Liesegang’s rings is but a particular and striking case of a more
general phenomenon, namely the influence on cry­stal­li­sa­tion of
the presence of foreign bodies or “impurities,” represented in this
case by the “gel” or colloid matrix<a class="afnanch" href="#fn437" id="fnanch437">437</a>.
Faraday shewed long ago
that to the presence of slight impurities might be ascribed the
banded structure of ice, of banded quartz or agate, onyx, etc.;
and Quincke and Tomlinson have added to our scanty knowledge
of the same phenomenon<a class="afnanch" href="#fn438" id="fnanch438">438</a>.</p>

 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 205. Liesegang’s Rings. (After Leduc.)</div></div>

<p>Besides the tendency to rhythmic action, as manifested in
Liesegang’s rings, the association of colloid matter with a crystalloid
in solution may lead to other well-marked effects. These,
according to Professor J. H. Bowman<a class="afnanch" href="#fn439" id="fnanch439">439</a>,
may be grouped somewhat
as follows: (1) total prevention of cry­stal­li­sa­tion; (2) suppression of
certain of the lines of crystalline growth; (3) extension of the crystal
to abnormal proportions, with a tendency for it to become a compound
crystal; (4) a curving or gyrating of the
crystal or its parts. <span class="xxpn" id="p429">{429}</span></p>

 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 206. Relay-crystals
 of common salt. (After Bowman.)</div></div>

<p>For instance, it would seem that, if the supply of material to
the growing crystal be not forthcoming in sufficient quantity (as
may well happen in a colloid medium, for lack of convection-currents),
then growth will follow only the strongest lines of
crystallising force, and will be suppressed or partially suppressed
along other axes. The crystal will have a tendency to become
filiform, or “fibrous”; and the raphides of our plant-cells are
a case in point. Again, the long slender crystal so formed, pushing
its way into new material, may initiate a new centre of cry­stal­li­sa­tion:
we get the phenomenon known as a “relay,” along the</p>

 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 207. Wheel-like crystals in a

<p class="pcontinue"> principal lines of force,
and sometimes along subordinate axes as well. This
phenomenon is illustrated in the accompanying figure of
cry­stal­li­sa­tion in a colloid medium of common salt; and it
may possibly be that we have here an explanation, or part
of an explanation, of the compound siliceous spicules of
the Hexactinellid sponges. Lastly, when the crystallising
force is nearly equalled by the resistance of the viscous
medium, the crystal takes the line of least resistance,
with very various results. One of these results would
seem to be a gyratory course, giving to the crystal a
curious wheel-like shape, as in Fig. <a href="#fig207" title="go to Fig. 207">207</a>; and other
results are the feathery, fern-like <span class="xxpn"
id="p430">{430}</span> or arborescent shapes so frequently
seen in microscopic cry­stal­li­sa­tion. <br class="brclrfix"
/></p>

<p>To return to Liesegang’s rings, the typical appearance of
concentric rings upon a gelatinous plate may be modified in
various experimental ways. For instance, our gelatinous medium
may be placed in a capillary tube immersed in a solution of the
precipitating salt, and in this case we shall obtain a vertical
succession of bands or zones regularly interspaced: the result being
very closely comparable to the banded pigmentation which we see
in the hair of a rabbit or a rat. In the ordinary plate preparation,
the free surface of the gelatine is under different conditions to the
lower layers and especially to the lowest layer in contact with
the glass; and therefore it often happens that we obtain a double
series of rings, one deep and the other superficial, which by
occasional blending or interlacing, may produce a netted pattern.
In some cases, as when only the inner surface of our capillary
tube is covered with a layer of gelatine, there is a tendency for
the deposit to take place in a continuous spiral line, rather than
in concentric and separate zones. By such means, according to
Küster<a class="afnanch" href="#fn440" id="fnanch440">440</a>
various forms of annular, spiral and reticulated thickenings
in the vascular tissue of plants may be closely imitated; and he
and certain other writers have of late been inclined to carry the
same chemico-physical phenomenon a very long way, in the
explanation of various banded, striped, and other rhythmically
successional types of structure or pigmentation. For example,
the striped pigmentation of the leaves in many plants (such as
<i>Eulalia japonica</i>), the striped or clouded colouring of many
feathers or of a cat’s skin, the patterns of many fishes, such for
instance as the brightly coloured tropical Chaetodonts and the like,
are all regarded by him as so many instances of “diffusion-figures”
closely related to the typical Liesegang phenomenon. Gebhardt
has made a particular study of the same subject in the case of
insects<a class="afnanch" href="#fn441" id="fnanch441">441</a>.
He declares, for instance, that the banded wings of
<i>Papilio podalirius</i> are precisely imitated in Liesegang’s experiments;
that the finer markings on the wings of the Goatmoth
(<i>Cossus ligniperda</i>) shew the double arrangement
of larger and of <span class="xxpn" id="p431">{431}</span>
smaller intermediate rhythms, likewise manifested in certain cases
of the same kind; that the alternate banding of the antennae
(for instance in <i>Sesia spheciformis</i>), a pigmentation not concurrent
with the segmented structure of the antenna, is explicable in the
same way; and that the “ocelli,” for instance of the Emperor
moth, are typical illustrations of the common concentric type.
Darwin’s well-known disquisition<a class="afnanch" href="#fn442" id="fnanch442">442</a>
on the ocellar pattern of the
feathers of the Argus Pheasant, as a result of sexual selection,
will occur to the reader’s mind, in striking contrast to this or
to any other direct physical explanation<a class="afnanch" href="#fn443" id="fnanch443">443</a>.
To turn from the distribution
of pigment to more deeply seated structural characters,
Leduc has shewn how, for instance, the laminar structure of the
cornea or the lens is again, apparently, a similar phenomenon.
In the lens of the fish’s eye, we have a very curious appearance,
the consecutive lamellae being roughened or notched by close-set,
interlocking sinuosities; and precisely the same appearance, save
that it is not quite so regular, is presented in one of Küster’s
figures as the effect of precipitating a little sodium phosphate in
a gelatinous medium. Biedermann has studied, from the same
point of view, the structure and development of the molluscan
shell, the problem which Rainey had first attacked more than
fifty years before<a class="afnanch" href="#fn444" id="fnanch444">444</a>;
and Liesegang himself has applied his results
to the formation of pearls, and to the
development of bone<a class="afnanch" href="#fn445" id="fnanch445">445</a>.
<span class="xxpn" id="p432">{432}</span></p>

<p>Among all the many cases where this phenomenon of Liesegang’s
comes to the naturalist’s aid in explanation of rhythmic or
zonary con­fi­gur­a­tions in organic forms, it has a special interest
where the presence of concentric zones or rings appears, at
first sight, as a sure and certain sign of periodicity of growth,
depending on the seasons, and capable therefore of serving as
a mark and record of the creature’s age. This is the case, for
instance, with the scales, bones and otoliths of fishes; and a
kindred phenomena in starch-grains has given rise, in like manner,
to the belief that they indicate a diurnal and nocturnal periodicity
of activity and rest<a class="afnanch" href="#fn446" id="fnanch446">446</a>.</p>

<img src="images/i432a.png" width="144" height="180" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 208.</div></div>

<p>That this is actually the case in growing starch-grains is
generally believed, on the authority of Meyer<a class="afnanch" href="#fn447" id="fnanch447">447</a>;
but while under
certain circumstances a marked alternation of growing and resting
periods may occur, and may leave its impress on the structure
of the grain, there is now great reason to believe that, apart from
such external influences, the internal phenomena of
diffusion may, just as in the typical Liesegang
experiment, produce the well-known concentric
rings. The spherocrystals of inulin, in like manner,
shew, like the “cal­co­sphe­rites” of Harting (Fig.
<a href="#fig208" title="go to Fig. 208">208</a>), a concentric structure which in all likelihood
has had no causative impulse save from within.<br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<p>The striation, or concentric lamellation, of the scales
and otoliths of fishes has been much employed of recent
years as a trustworthy and unmistakeable mark of the fish’s
age. There are difficulties in the way of accepting this
hypothesis, not the least of which is the fact that the
otolith-zones, for instance, are extremely well marked
even in the case of some fishes which spend their lives
in deep water, <span class="xxpn" id="p433">{433}</span>
where the temperature and other physical conditions shew
little or no appreciable fluctuation with the seasons
of the year. There are, on the other hand, phenomena
which seem strongly confirmatory of the hypothesis: for
instance the fact (if it be fully established) that in
such a fish as the cod, zones of growth, <i>identical in
number</i>, are found both on the scales and in the otoliths&#xfeff;<a
class="afnanch" href="#fn448" id="fnanch448">448</a>. The
subject has become a much debated one, and this is not the
place for its discussion; but it is at least obvious, with
the Liesegang phenomenon in view, that we have no right
to <i>assume</i> that an appearance of rhythm and periodicity
in structure and growth is necessarily bound up with, and
indubitably brought about by, a periodic recurrence of
particular <i>external</i> conditions.</p>

<p>But while in the Liesegang phenomenon we have rhythmic
precipitation which depends only on forces intrinsic to the
system, and is independent of any cor­re­spon­ding rhythmic
changes in temperature or other external conditions, we
have not far to seek for instances of chemico-physical
phenomena where rhythmic alternations of appearance or
structure are produced in close relation to periodic
fluctuations of temperature. A well-known instance is that
of the Stassfurt deposits, where the rock-salt alternates
regularly with thin layers of “anhydrite,” or (in another
series of beds) with “polyhalite<a class="afnanch"
href="#fn449" id="fnanch449">449</a>”: and where these
zones are commonly regarded as marking years, and their
alternate bands as having been formed in connection with
the seasons. A discussion, however, of this remarkable and
significant phenomenon, and of how the chemist explains it,
by help of the “phase-rule,” in connection with temperature
conditions, would lead us far beyond our scope&#xfeff;<a
class="afnanch" href="#fn450" id="fnanch450">450</a>. <br
class="brclrfix" /></p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>We now see that the methods by which we attempt to study
the chemical or chemico-physical phenomena which accompany
the development of an inorganic concretion
or spicule within the <span class="xxpn" id="p434">{434}</span>
body of an organism soon introduce us to a multitude of kindred
phenomena, of which our knowledge is still scanty, and which we
must not attempt to discuss at greater length. As regards our
main point, namely the formation of spicules and other elementary
skeletal forms, we have seen that certain of them may be safely
ascribed to simple precipitation or cry­stal­li­sa­tion of inorganic
materials, in ways more or less modified by the presence of
albuminous or other colloid substances. The effect of these
latter is found to be much greater in the case of some crystallisable
bodies than in others. For instance, Harting, and Rainey also,
found as a rule that calcium oxalate was much less affected by
a colloid medium than was calcium carbonate; it shewed in
their hands no tendency to form rounded concretions or “cal­co­sphe­rites”
in presence of a colloid, but continued to crystallise,
either normally, or with a tendency to form needles or raphides.
It is doubtless for this reason that, as we have seen, <i>crystals</i> of
calcium oxalate are so common in the tissues of plants, while
those of other calcium salts are rare. But true cal­co­sphe­rites,
or spherocrystals, of the oxalate are occasionally found, for
instance in certain Cacti, and Bütschli<a class="afnanch" href="#fn451" id="fnanch451">451</a>
has succeeded in making
them artificially in Harting’s usual way, that is to say by cry­stal­li­sa­tion
in a colloid medium.</p>

<p>There link on to these latter observations, and to the statement
already quoted that calcareous deposits are associated with the
dead products rather than with the living cells of the organism,
certain very interesting facts in regard to the <i>solubility</i> of salts
in colloid media, which have been made known to us of late, and
which go far to account for the presence (apart from the form)
of calcareous precipitates within the organism<a class="afnanch" href="#fn452" id="fnanch452">452</a>.
It has been
shewn, in the first place, that the presence of albumin has a notable
effect on the solubility in a watery solution of calcium salts,
increasing the solubility of the phosphate in a marked degree,
and that of the carbonate in still greater
proportion; but the <span class="xxpn" id="p435">{435}</span>
sulphate is only very little more soluble in presence of albumin
than in pure water, and the rarity of its occurrence within the
organism is so far accounted for. On the other hand, the bodies
derived from the breaking down of the albumins, their “catabolic”
products, such as the peptones, etc., dissolve the calcium salts to
a much less degree than albumin itself; and in the case of the
phosphate, its solubility in them is scarcely greater than in water.
The probability is, therefore, that the actual precipitation of the
calcium salts is not due to the direct action of carbonic acid, etc.
on a more soluble salt (as was at one time believed); but to catabolic
changes in the proteids of the organism, which tend to throw
down the salts already formed, which had remained hitherto in
albuminous solution. The very slight solubility of calcium phosphate
under such circumstances accounts for its predominance
in, for instance, mammalian bone<a class="afnanch" href="#fn453" id="fnanch453">453</a>;
and wherever, in short, the
supply of this salt has been available to the organism.</p>

<p>To sum up, we see that, whether from food or from sea-water,
calcium sulphate will tend to pass but little into solution in the
albuminoid substances of the body: calcium carbonate will enter
more freely, but a considerable part of it will tend to remain in
solution: while calcium phosphate will pass into solution in
considerable amount, but will be almost wholly precipitated
again, as the albumin becomes broken down in the normal process
of metabolism.</p>

<p>We have still to wait for a similar and equally illuminating
study of the solution and precipitation of <i>silica</i>, in presence of
organic colloids.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>From the comparatively small group of inorganic formations
which, arising within living organisms, owe their form solely to
precipitation or to cry­stal­li­sa­tion, that is to say to chemical or other
molecular forces, we shall presently pass to that other and larger
group which appear to be conformed in direct relation to the forms
and the arrangement of the cells or other
protoplasmic elements<a class="afnanch" href="#fn454" id="fnanch454">454</a>.
<span class="xxpn" id="p436">{436}</span>
The two principles of conformation are both illustrated in the
spicular skeletons of the Sponges.</p>

<p>In a considerable number, but withal a minority of cases, the
form of the sponge-spicule may be deemed sufficiently explained
on the lines of Harting’s and Rainey’s experiments, that is to say
as the direct result of chemical or physical phenomena associated
with the deposition of lime or of silica in presence of colloids<a class="afnanch" href="#fn455" id="fnanch455">455</a>.
This is the case, for instance, with various small spicules of a
globular or spheroidal form, formed of amorphous silica, concentrically
striated within, and often developing irregular knobs
or tiny tubercles over their surfaces. In the aberrant sponge
<i>Astrosclera</i><a class="afnanch" href="#fn456" id="fnanch456">456</a>,
we have, to begin with, rounded, striated discs or
globules, which in like manner are nothing more
or less than the <span class="xxpn" id="p437">{437}</span>
“cal­co­sphe­rites” of Harting’s experiments; and as these grow
they become closely aggregated together (Fig. <a href="#fig210" title="go to Fig. 210">210</a>), and assume an
angular, polyhedral form, once more in complete accordance with
the results of experiment<a class="afnanch" href="#fn457" id="fnanch457">457</a>.
Again, in many Monaxonid sponges,
we have irregularly shaped, or branched spicules, roughened or
tuberculated by secondary superficial deposits, and reminding one
of the spicules of some Alcyonaria. These also must be looked
upon as the simple result of chemical deposition, the form of the
deposit being somewhat modified in conformity with the surrounding
tissues, just as in the simple experiment the form of the concretionary
precipitate is affected by the heterogeneity, visible or
invisible, of the matrix. Lastly, the simple needles of amorphous
silica, which constitute one of the commonest types of spicule,
call for little in the way of explanation; they are accretions or
deposits about a linear axis, or fine thread of organic material,
just as the ordinary rounded calcospherite is deposited about
some minute point or centre of cry­stal­li­sa­tion, and as ordinary
cry­stal­li­sa­tion is often started by a particle of atmospheric dust;
in some cases they also, like the others, are apt to be roughened
by more irregular secondary deposits, which probably, as in
Harting’s experiments, appear in this irregular form when the
supply of material has become relatively scanty.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Our few foregoing examples, diverse as they are in look and
kind and ranging from the spicules of Astrosclera or Alcyonium
to the otoliths of a fish, seem all to have their free origin in some
larger or smaller fluid-containing space, or cavity of the body:
pretty much as Harting’s calcospheres made their appearance in
the albuminous content of a dish. But we now come at last to
a much larger class of spicular and skeletal structures, for whose
regular and often complex forms some other explanation than the
intrinsic forces of cry­stal­li­sa­tion or molecular adhesion is manifestly
necessary. As we enter on this subject, which is certainly
no small or easy one, it may conduce to simplicity,
and to brevity, <span class="xxpn" id="p438">{438}</span>
if we try to make a rough clas­si­fi­ca­tion, by way of forecast, of
the chief conditions which we are likely to meet with.</p>

<p>Just as we look upon animals as constituted, some of a vast
number of cells, and others of a single cell or of a very few, and
just as the shape of the former has no longer a visible relation to
the individual shapes of its constituent cells, while in the latter
it is cell-form which dominates or is actually equivalent to the
form of the organism, so shall we find it to be, with more or less
exact analogy, in the case of the skeleton. For example, our own
skeleton consists of bones, in the formation of each of which a
vast number of minute living cellular elements are necessarily
concerned; but the form and even the arrangement of these
bone-forming cells or corpuscles are monotonously simple, and we
cannot find in these a physical explanation of the outward and
visible configuration of the bone. It is as part of a far larger
field of force,—in which we must consider gravity, the action of
various muscles, the compressions, tensions and bending moments
due to variously distributed loads, the whole interaction of a very
complex mechanical system,—that we must explain (if we are to
explain at all) the configuration of a bone.</p>

<p>In contrast to these massive skeletons, or constituents of a
skeleton, we have other skeletal elements whose whole magnitude,
or whose magnitude in some dimension or another, is commensurate
with the magnitude of a single living cell, or (as comes to very
much the same thing) is comparable to the range of action of the
molecular forces. Such is the case with the ordinary spicules of
a sponge, with the delicate skeleton of a Radiolarian, or with the
denser and robuster shells of the Foraminifera. The effect of
<i>scale</i>, then, of which we had so much to say in our introductory
chapter on Magnitude, is bound to be apparent in the study of
skeletal fabrics, and to lead to essential differences between the
big and the little, the massive and the minute, in regard to their
controlling forces and their resultant forms. And if all this be
so, and if the range of action of the molecular forces be in truth
the important and fundamental thing, then we may somewhat
extend our statement of the case, and include in it not only
association with the living cellular elements of the body, but also
association with any bubbles, drops, vacuoles
or vesicles which <span class="xxpn" id="p439">{439}</span>
may be comprised within the bounds of the organism, and which
are (as their names and characters connote) of the order of
magnitude of which we are speaking.</p>

<p>Proceeding a little farther in our clas­si­fi­ca­tion, we may conceive
each little skeletal element to be associated, in one case, with
a single cell or vesicle, and in another with a cluster or “system”
of consociated cells. In either case there are various possibilities.
For instance, the calcified or other skeletal material may tend
to overspread the entire outer surface of the cell or cluster of cells,
and so tend accordingly to assume some configuration comparable
to that of a fluid drop or of an aggregation of drops; this, in brief,
is the gist and essence of our story of the foraminiferal shell.
Another common, but very different condition will arise if, in the
case of the cell-aggregates, the skeletal material tends to accumulate
in the interstices <i>between</i> the cells, in the partition-walls which
separate them, or in the still more restricted distribution indicated
by the <i>lines</i> of junction between these partition-walls. Conditions
such as these will go a very long way to help us in our understanding
of many sponge-spicules and of an immense variety of
radiolarian skeletons. And lastly (for the present), there is a
possible and very interesting case of a skeletal element associated
with the surface of a cell, not so as to cover it like a shell, but
only so as to pursue a course of its own within it, and subject to
the restraints imposed by such confinement to a curved and
limited surface. With this curious condition we shall deal
immediately.</p>

<p>This preliminary and much simplified clas­si­fi­ca­tion of skeletal
forms (as is evident enough) does not pretend to completeness.
It leaves out of account some kinds of conformation and configuration
with which we shall attempt to deal, and others which
we must perforce omit. But nevertheless it may help to clear
or to mark our way towards the subjects which this chapter has
to consider, and the conditions by which they are at least partially
defined.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Among the several possible, or conceivable, types of microscopic
skeletons let us choose, to begin with, the case of a spicule, more
or less simply linear as far as its <i>intrinsic</i> powers
of growth are <span class="xxpn" id="p440">{440}</span>
concerned, but which owes its now somewhat complicated form
to a restraint imposed by the individual cell to which it is confined,
and within whose bounds it is generated. The conception of a
spicule developed under such conditions we owe to a distinguished
physicist, the late Professor G. F. FitzGerald.</p>

<p>Many years ago, Sollas pointed out that if a spicule begin to
grow in some particular way, presumably under the control or
constraint imposed by the organism, it continues to grow by
further chemical deposition in the same form or direction even
after it has got beyond the boundaries of the organism or its
cells. This phenomenon is what we see in, and this imperfect
explanation goes so far to account for, the continued growth in
straight lines of the long calcareous spines of Globigerina or
Hastigerina, or the similarly radiating but siliceous spicules of
many Radiolaria. In physical language, if our crystalline
structure has once begun to be laid down in a definite orientation,
further additions tend to accrue in a like regular fashion and in
an identical direction; and this corresponds to the phenomenon
of so-called “orientirte Adsorption,” as described by Lehmann.</p>

<p>In Globigerina or in Acanthocystis the long needles grow out
freely into the surrounding medium, with nothing to impede their
rectilinear growth and their ap­prox­i­mate­ly radiate distribution.
But let us consider some simple cases to illustrate the forms which
a spicule will tend to assume when, striving (as it were) to grow
straight, it comes under the influence of some simple and constant
restraint or compulsion.</p>

<p>If we take any two points on some curved surface, such as
that of a sphere or an ellipsoid, and imagine a string stretched
between them, we obtain what is known in mathematics as a
“geodetic” curve. It is the shortest line which can be traced
between the two points, upon the surface itself; and the most
familiar of all cases, from which the name is derived, is that curve
upon the earth’s surface which the navigator learns to follow in
the practice of “great-circle sailing.” Where the surface is
spherical, the geodetic is always literally a “great circle,” a circle,
that is to say, whose centre is the centre of the sphere. If instead
of a sphere we be dealing with an ellipsoid, the geodetic becomes
a variable figure, according to the position of
our two points. <span class="xxpn" id="p441">{441}</span>
For obviously, if they lie in a line perpendicular to the long axis
of the ellipsoid, the geodetic which connects them is a circle, also
perpendicular to that axis; and if they lie in a line parallel to
the axis, their geodetic is a portion of that ellipse about which
the whole figure is a solid of revolution. But if our two points
lie, relatively to one another, in any other direction, then their
geodetic is part of a spiral curve in space, winding over the surface
of the ellipsoid.</p>

<p>To say, as we have done, that the geodetic is the shortest line
between two points upon the surface, is as much as to say that
it is a <i>projection</i> of some particular straight line upon the surface
in question; and it follows that, if any linear body be confined
to that surface, while retaining a tendency to grow by successive
increments always (save only for its confinement to that surface)
in a straight line, the resultant form which it will assume will be
that of a geodetic. In math­e­mat­i­cal language, it is a property
of a geodetic that the plane of any two consecutive elements is
a plane perpendicular to that in which the geodetic lies; or, in
simpler words, any two consecutive elements lie in a straight line
<i>in the plane of the surface</i>, and only diverge from a straight line
in space by the actual curvature of the surface to which they are
restrained.</p>

<p>Let us now imagine a spicule, whose natural tendency is to
grow into a straight linear element, either by reason of its own
molecular anisotropy, or because it is deposited about a thread-like
axis; and let us suppose that it is confined either within a
cell-wall or in adhesion thereto; it at once follows that its line
of growth will be simply a geodetic to the surface of the cell.
And if the cell be an imperfect sphere, or a more or less regular
ellipsoid, the spicule will tend to grow into one or other of three
forms: either a plane curve of circular arc; or, more commonly,
a plane curve which is a portion of an ellipse; or, most commonly
of all, a curve which is a portion of a spiral in space. In the
latter case, the number of turns of the spiral will depend, not only
on the length of the spicule, but on the relative dimensions of
the ellipsoidal cell, as well as upon the angle by which the spicule
is inclined to the ellipsoid axes; but a very common case will
probably be that in which the spicule looks at first
sight to be <span class="xxpn" id="p442">{442}</span>
a plane <span class="nowrap"><em class="emltr">C</em>-shaped</span>
figure, but is discovered, on more careful inspection,
to lie not in one plane but in a more complicated spiral twist.</p>

obtain a series of more complex figures, all related to
the geodetic system of curves. A very simple case will
arise where the spicule occupies, in the first instance,
the axis of the containing cell, and then, on reaching its
boundary, tends to branch or spread outwards. We shall now
get various figures, in some
of which the spicule will appear as an axis
expanding into a disc or wheel at either
end; and in other cases, the terminal disc

will be replaced, or represented, by a series
of rays or spokes, with a reflex curvature,
cor­re­spon­ding to the spherical or ellipsoid
curvature of the surface of the cell. Such
spicules as these are again exceedingly
common among various sponges (Fig. <a href="#fig213" title="go to Fig. 213">213</a>).</p>

<p>Furthermore, if these mechanical methods
of conformation, and others like to these,
be the true cause of the shapes which the
spicules assume, it is plain that the production
of these spicular shapes is not a specific function of
sponges or of any particular sponge, but that
we should expect <span class="xxpn" id="p443">{443}</span>
the same or very similar phenomena to occur in other organisms,
wherever the conditions of inorganic secretion within closed cells
was very much the same. As a matter of fact, in the group of
Holothuroidea, where the formation of intracellular spicules is a
char­ac­ter­is­tic feature of the group, all the principal types of
conformation which we have just described can be closely
paralleled. Indeed in many cases, the forms of the Holothurian
spicules are identical and in­dis­tin­guish­able from those of the
sponges<a class="afnanch" href="#fn458" id="fnanch458">458</a>.
But the Holothurian spicules are composed of calcium
carbonate while those which we have just described in the case
of sponges are usually, if not always, siliceous: this being just
another proof of the fact that in such cases the form of the
spicule is not due to its chemical nature or molecular structure,
but to the external forces to which, during its growth, the
spicule is submitted.<br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>So much for that comparatively limited class of sponge-spicules
whose forms seem capable of explanation on the hypothesis
that they are developed within, or under the restraint imposed by,
the surface of a cell or vesicle. Such spicules are usually of small
size, as well as of comparatively simple form; and they are greatly
outstripped in number, in size, and in supposed importance as
guides to zoological clas­si­fi­ca­tion, by another class of spicules.
This new class includes such as we have supposed to be capable
of explanation on the assumption that they develop in association
(of some sort or another) with the <i>lines of junction</i> of contiguous
cells. They include the triradiate spicules of the calcareous
sponges, the quadriradiate or “tetractinellid” spicules which occur
in the same group, but more char­ac­teris­ti­cally in certain siliceous
sponges known as the Tetractinellidae, and lastly perhaps (though
these last are admittedly somewhat harder to understand) the
six-rayed spicules of the Hexactinellids.</p>

<p>The spicules of the calcareous sponges are commonly
triradiate, and the three radii are usually inclined to one
another at equal, or nearly equal angles; in certain cases,
two of the three rays are nearly in a straight line, and at
right angles to the <span class="xxpn" id="p444">{444}</span>
third<a class="afnanch" href="#fn459" id="fnanch459">459</a>.
They are seldom in a plane, but are usually inclined to
one another in a solid, trihedral angle, not easy of precise measurement
under the microscope. The three rays are very often
supplemented by a fourth, which is set tetrahedrally, making, that
is to say, coequal angles with the other three. The calcareous
spicule consists mainly of carbonate of lime, in the form of calcite,
with (according to von Ebner) some admixture of soda and
magnesia, of sulphates and of water. According to the same
writer (but the fact, though it would seem easy to test, is still
disputed) there is no organic matter in the spicule, either in the
form of an axial filament or otherwise, and the appearance of
stratification, often simulating the presence of an axial fibre, is
due to “mixed cry­stal­li­sa­tion” of the various constituents. The
spicule is a true crystal, and therefore its existence and its form
are <i>primarily</i> due to the molecular forces of cry­stal­li­sa­tion; moreover
it is a single crystal and not a group of crystals, as is at once
seen by its behaviour in polarised light. But its axes are not
crystalline axes, and its form neither agrees with, nor in any way
resembles, any one of the many polymorphic forms in which
calcite is capable of crystallising. It is as though it were carved
out of a solid crystal; it is, in fact, a crystal under restraint,
a crystal growing, as it were, in an artificial mould; and this
mould is constituted by the surrounding cells, or structural
vesicles of the sponge.</p>

<p>We have already studied in an elementary way, but amply
for our present purpose, the manner in which three or more cells,
or bubbles, tend to meet together under the influence of surface-tension,
and also the outwardly similar phenomena which may be
brought about by a uniform distribution of mechanical pressure.
We have seen that when we confine ourselves to a plane assemblage
of such bodies, we find them meeting one another in threes; that
in a section or plane projection of such an assemblage we see the
partition-walls meeting one another at equal angles of 120°; that
when the bodies are uniform in size, the partitions are straight
lines, which combine to form regular hexagons;
and that when <span class="xxpn" id="p445">{445}</span>
the bodies are unequal in size, the partitions are curved, and
combine to form other and less regular polygons. It is plain,
accordingly, that in any flattened or stratified assemblage of such
cells, a solidified skeletal deposit which originates or accumulates
either between the cells or within the thickness of their mutual
partitions, will tend to take the form of triradiate bodies, whose
rays (in a typical case) will be set at equal angles of 120° (Fig. <a href="#fig214" title="go to Fig. 214">214</a>, <i>F</i>).
And this latter condition of equality will be open to modification
in various ways. It will be</p>

<div class="dctr03" id="fig214">
<img src="images/i445.png" width="607" height="637" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 214. Spicules of Grantia and
 other calcareous sponges. (After Haeckel.)</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">
modified by any inequality in the
specific tensions of adjacent cells; as a special case, it will be apt
to be greatly modified at the surface of the system, where a spicule
happens to be formed in a plane perpendicular to the cell-layer,
so that one of its three rays lies between two adjacent cells and
the other two are associated with the surface of contact between
the cells and the surrounding medium; in such a case (as in the
cases considered in connection with the forms of
the cells themselves <span class="xxpn" id="p446">{446}</span>
on p. <a href="#p314" title="go to pg. 314">314</a>), we shall tend to obtain a spicule with two equal angles
and one unequal (Fig. <a href="#fig214" title="go to Fig. 214">214</a>, <i>A</i>, <i>C</i>). In the last case, the two outer,
or superficial rays, will tend to be markedly curved. Again, the
equiangular condition will be departed from, and more or less
curvature will be imparted to the rays, wherever the cells of the
system cease to be uniform in size, and when the hexagonal
symmetry of the system is lost accordingly. Lastly, although we
speak of the rays as meeting at certain definite angles, this statement
applies to their <i>axes</i>, rather than to the rays themselves.
For, if the triradiate spicule be developed in the <i>interspace</i> between
three juxtaposed cells, it is obvious that its sides will tend to be
concave, for the interspace between our three contiguous equal
circles is an equilateral, curvilinear triangle; and even if our
spicule be deposited, not in the space between our three cells,
but in the thickness of the intervening wall, then we may recollect
(from p. <a href="#p297" title="go to pg. 297">297</a>) that the several partitions never actually meet at
sharp angles, but the angle of contact is always bridged over by
a small accumulation of material (varying in amount according
to its fluidity) whose boundary takes the form of a circular arc,
and which constitutes the “bourrelet” of Plateau.</p>

<p>In any sample of the triradiate spicules of Grantia, or in any
series of careful drawings, such as those of Haeckel among others,
we shall find that all these various con­fi­gur­a­tions are precisely
and completely illustrated.</p>

<p>The tetrahedral, or rather tetractinellid, spicule needs no
explanation in detail (Fig. <a href="#fig214" title="go to Fig. 214">214</a>, <i>D</i>, <i>E</i>). For just as a triradiate
spicule corresponds to the case of three cells in mutual contact,
so does the four-rayed spicule to that of a solid aggregate of four
cells: these latter tending to meet one another in a tetrahedral
system, shewing four edges, at each of which four surfaces meet,
the edges being inclined to one another at equal angles of about
109°. And even in the case of a single layer, or superficial layer,
of cells, if the skeleton originate in connection with all the edges
of mutual contact, we shall, in complete and typical cases, have
a four-rayed spicule, of which one straight limb will correspond
to the line of junction between the three cells, and the other three
limbs (which will then be curved limbs) will correspond to the edges
where two cells meet one another on the surface
of the system. <span class="xxpn" id="p447">{447}</span></p>

<p>But if such a physical explanation of the forms of our spicules
is to be accepted, we must seek at once for some physical agency
by which we may explain the presence of the solid material just
at the junctions or interfaces of the cells, and for the forces by
which it is confined to, and moulded to the form of, these intercellular
or interfacial contacts. It is to Dreyer that we chiefly
owe the physical or mechanical theory of spicular conformation
which I have just described,—a theory which ultimately rests
on the form assumed, under surface-tension, by an aggregation
of cells or vesicles. But this fundamental point being granted,
we have still several possible alternatives by which to explain the
details of the phenomenon.</p>

<p>Dreyer, if I understand him aright, was content to assume that
the solid material, secreted or excreted by the organism, accumulated
in the interstices between the cells, and was there subjected
to mechanical pressure or constraint as the cells got more and
more crowded together by their own growth and that of the
system generally. As far as the general form of the spicules goes,
such explanation is not inadequate, though under it we may have
to renounce some of our assumptions as to what takes place at
the outer surface of the system.</p>

<p>But in all (or most) cases where, but a few years ago, the
concepts of secretion or excretion seemed precise enough, we are
now-a-days inclined to turn to the phenomenon of adsorption as
a further stage towards the elucidation of our facts. Here we
have a case in point. In the tissues of our sponge, wherever two
cells meet, there we have a definite <i>surface</i> of contact, and there
accordingly we have a manifestation of surface-energy; and the
concentration of surface-energy will tend to be a maximum at
the <i>lines</i> or edges whereby the three, or four, such surfaces are
conjoined. Of the micro-chemistry of the sponge-cells our
ignorance is great; but (without venturing on any hypothesis
involving the chemical details of the process) we may safely assert
that there is an inherent probability that certain substances will
tend to be concentrated and ultimately deposited just in these lines
of intercellular contact and conjunction. In other words, adsorptive
concentration, under osmotic pressure, at and in the surface-film
which constitutes the mutual
boundary between contiguous <span class="xxpn" id="p448">{448}</span>
cells, emerges as an alternative (and, as it seems to me, a highly
preferable alternative) to Dreyer’s conception of an accumulation
under mechanical pressure in the vacant spaces left between one
cell and another.</p>

<p>But a purely chemical, or purely molecular adsorption, is not
the only form of the hypothesis on which we may rely. For
from the purely physical point of view, angles and edges of contact
between adjacent cells will be <i>loci</i> in the field of distribution of
surface-energy, and any material particles whatsoever will tend
to undergo a diminution of freedom on entering one of those
boundary regions. In a very simple case, let us imagine a couple
of soap bubbles in contact with one another. Over the surface
of each bubble there glide in every direction, as usual, a multitude
of tiny bubbles and droplets; but as soon as these find their way
into the groove or re-entrant angle between the two bubbles,
there their freedom of movement is so far restrained, and out of
that groove they have little or no tendency to emerge. A cognate
phenomenon is to be witnessed in microscopic sections of steel or
other metals. Here, amid the “crystalline” structure of the
metal (where in cooling its imperfectly homogeneous material has
developed a cellular structure, shewing (in section) hexagonal or
polygonal contours), we can easily observe, as Professor Peddie
has shewn me, that the little particles of graphite and other
foreign bodies common in the matrix, have tended to aggregate
themselves in the walls and at the angles of the polygonal
cells—this being a direct result of the diminished freedom
which the particles undergo on entering one of these boundary
regions<a class="afnanch" href="#fn460" id="fnanch460">460</a>.</p>

<p>It is by a combination of these two principles, chemical adsorption
on the one hand, and physical quasi-adsorption or concentration
of grosser particles on the other, that I conceive the substance
of the sponge-spicule to be concentrated and aggregated at the
cell boundaries; and the forms of the triradiate and tetractinellid
spicules are in precise conformity with this hypothesis. A few
general matters, and a few particular cases,
remain to be considered.</p>

<p>It matters little or not at all, for the phenomenon in
question, <span class="xxpn" id="p449">{449}</span>
what is the histological nature or “grade” of the vesicular structures
on which it depends. In some cases (apart from sponges), they
may be no more than the little alveoli of the intracellular protoplasmic
network, and this would seem to be the case at least in
one known case, that of the protozoan <i>Entosolenia aspera</i>, in which,
within the vesicular protoplasm of the single cell, Möbius has
described tiny spicules in the shape of little tetrahedra with
concave sides. It is probably also the case in the small beginnings
of the Echinoderm spicules, which are likewise intracellular, and
are of similar shape. In the case of our sponges we have many
varying conditions, which we need not attempt to examine in
detail. In some cases there is evidence for believing that the
spicule is formed at the boundaries of true cells or histological
units. But in the case of the larger triradiate or tetractinellid
spicules of the sponge-body, they far surpass in size the actual
“cells”; we find them lying, regularly and symmetrically
arranged, between the “pore-canals” or “ciliated chambers,”
and it is in conformity with the shape and arrangement of these
rounded or spheroidal structures that their shape is assumed.</p>

<p>Again, it is not necessarily at variance with our hypothesis
to find that, in the adult sponge, the larger spicules may greatly
outgrow the bounds not only of actual cells but also of the
ciliated chambers, and may even appear to project freely from the
surface of the sponge. For we have already seen that the spicule
is capable of growing, without marked change of form, by further
deposition, or cry­stal­li­sa­tion, of layer upon layer of calcareous
molecules, even in an artificial solution; and we are entitled to
believe that the same process may be carried on in the tissues of
the sponge, without greatly altering the symmetry of the spicule,
long after it has established its char­ac­ter­is­tic form of a system of
slender trihedral or tetrahedral rays.</p>

<p>Neither is it of great importance to our hypothesis whether
the rayed spicule necessarily arises as a single structure, or does
so from separate minute centres of aggregation. Minchin has
shewn that, in some cases at least, the latter is the case; the
spicule begins, he tells us, as three tiny rods, separate from one
another, each developed in the interspace between two sister-cells,
which are themselves the results of the division of
one of a <span class="xxpn" id="p450">{450}</span>
little trio of cells; and the little rods meet and fuse together while
still very minute, when the whole spicule is only about 1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;200 of a
millimetre long. At this stage, it is interesting to learn that the
spicule is non-crystalline; but the new accretions of calcareous
matter are soon deposited in crystalline form.</p>

<p>This observation threw considerable difficulties in the way of
former mechanical theories of the conformation of the spicule, and
was quite at variance with Dreyer’s theory, according to which
the spicule was bound to begin from a central nucleus coinciding
with the meeting-place of the three contiguous cells, or rather the
interspace between them. But the difficulty is removed when we
import the concept of adsorption; for by this agency it is natural
enough, or conceivable enough, that the process of deposition
should go on at separate parts of a common system of surfaces;
and if the cells tend to meet one another by their interfaces before
these interfaces extend to the angles and so complete the polygonal
cell, it is again conceivable and natural that the spicule should
first arise in the form of separate and detached limbs or rays.</p>

<p>Among the tetractinellid sponges, whose spicules are
composed of amorphous silica or opal, all or most of the
above-described main types of spicule occur, and, as the
name of the group implies, the four-rayed, tetrahedral
spicules are especially represented. A somewhat frequent
type of spicule is one in which one of the four rays is
greatly developed, and the other three constitute small
prongs diverging at equal angles from the main or axial
ray. In all probability, as Dreyer suggests, we have here
had to do with a group of four vesicles, of which three
were large and co-equal, while a fourth and very much
smaller one lay above and between the other three. In
certain cases where we have likewise one large and three
much smaller <span class="xxpn" id="p451">{451}</span>
rays, the latter are recurved, as in Fig. <a href="#fig215" title="go to Fig. 215">215</a>. This type,
save for the constancy of the number of rays, and the
limitation of the terminal ones to three, and save also
for the more important difference that they occur only
at one and not at both ends of the long axis, is similar
to the type of spicule illustrated in Fig. <a href="#fig213" title="go to Fig. 213">213</a>, which we
have explained as being probably developed within an oval
cell, by whose walls its branches have been conformed to
geodetic curves. But it is much more probable that we have
here to do with a spicule developed in the midst of a group
of three coequal and more or less elongated or cylindrical
cells or vesicles, the long axial ray cor­re­spon­ding to
their common line of contact, and the three short rays
having each lain in the surface furrow between two out of
the three adjacent cells.<br class="brclrfix" /></p>

spicules,
formed apparently within the bounds of a single cell, so also in
the case of the larger tetractinellid and analogous types do we
find among the Holothuroidea the same con­fi­gur­a­tions reproduced
as we have dealt with in the sponges. The holothurian spicules
are a little less neatly formed, a little rougher, than the sponge-spicules;
and certain forms occur among the former group which
do not present themselves among the latter; but for the most
part a community of type is obvious and striking (Fig. <a href="#fig216" title="go to Fig. 216">216</a>).</p>

<p>A curious and, physically speaking, strictly analogous formation
to the tetrahedral spicules of the sponges is
found in the <span class="xxpn" id="p452">{452}</span>
spores of a certain little group of parasitic protozoa, the Actinomyxidia.
These spores are formed from clusters of six cells,
of which three come to constitute the capsule of the spore; and
this capsule, always triradiate in its symmetry, is in some species
drawn out into long rays, of which one constitutes a straight
central axis, while the others, coming off from it at equal angles,
are recurved in wide circular arcs. The account given of the
development of this structure by its discoverers<a class="afnanch" href="#fn461" id="fnanch461">461</a>
is somewhat
obscure to me, but I think that, on physical grounds, there can
be no doubt whatever that the quadriradiate capsule has been
somehow modelled upon a group of three surrounding cells, its
axis lying between the three, and its three radial arcs occupying
the furrows between adjacent pairs.</p>

 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 217. Spicules of hexactinellid sponges.
 (After F. E. Schultze.)</div></div>

<p>The typically six-rayed siliceous spicules of the hexactinellid
sponges, while they are perhaps the most regular and beautifully
formed spicules to be found within the entire group, have been
found very difficult to explain, and Dreyer has confessed his
complete inability to account for their conformation. But,
though it is doubtless only throwing the difficulty a little further
back, we may so far account for them by considering that the
cells or vesicles by which they are conformed
are not arranged in <span class="xxpn" id="p453">{453}</span>
what is known as “closest packing,” but in linear series; so that in
their arrangement, and by their mutual compression, we tend to
get a pattern, not of hexagons, but of squares: or, looking to
the solid, not of dodecahedra but of cubes or parallelopipeda.
This indeed appears to be the case, not with the individual cells
(in the histological sense), but with the larger units or vesicles
which make up the body of the hexactinellid. And this being
so, the spicules formed between the linear, or cubical series of
vesicles, will have the same tendency towards a “hexactinellid”
shape, cor­re­spon­ding to the angles and adjacent edges of a system
of cubes, as in our former case they had to a triradiate or a
tetractinellid form, when developed in connection with the angles
and edges of a system of hexagons, or a system of dodecahedra.</p>

<p>Histologically, the case is illustrated by a well-known phenomenon
in embryology. In the segmenting ovum, there is a
tendency for the cells to be budded off in linear series; and so
they often remain, in rows side by side, at least for a considerable
time and during the course of several consecutive cell divisions.
Such an arrangement constitutes what the embryologists call the
“radial type” of segmentation<a class="afnanch" href="#fn462" id="fnanch462">462</a>.
But in what is described as the
“spiral type” of segmentation, it is stated that, as soon as the
first horizontal furrow has divided the cells into an upper and
a lower layer, those of “the upper layer are shifted in respect
to the lower layer, by means of a rotation about the vertical
axis<a class="afnanch" href="#fn463" id="fnanch463">463</a>.”
It is, of course, evident that the whole process is
merely that which is familiar to physicists as “close packing.”
It is a very simple case of what Lord Kelvin used to call
“a problem in tactics.” It is a mere question of the rigidity
of the system, of the freedom of movement on the part of
its constituent cells, whether or at what stage this tendency
to slip into the closest propinquity, or position of minimum
potential, will be found to manifest itself.</p>

<p>However the hexactinellid spicules be arranged
(and this is <span class="xxpn" id="p454">{454}</span>
not at all easy to determine) in relation to the tissues and chambers
of the sponge, it is at least clear that, whether they be separate
or be fused together (as often happens) in a composite skeleton,
they effect a symmetrical partitioning of space according to the
cubical system, in contrast to that closer packing which is represented
and effected by the tetrahedral system<a class="afnanch" href="#fn464" id="fnanch464">464</a>.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>This question of the origin and causation of the forms of
sponge-spicules, with which we have now briefly dealt, is all the
more important and all the more interesting because it has been
discussed time and again, from points of view which are char­ac­ter­is­tic
of very different schools of thought in biology. Haeckel
found in the form of the sponge-spicule a typical illustration of
his theory of “bio-cry­stal­li­sa­tion”; he considered that these
“biocrystals” represented “something midway—<i>ein Mittelding</i>—between
an inorganic crystal and an organic secretion”; that
there was a “compromise between the crystallising efforts of the
calcium carbonate and the formative activity of the fused cells
of the syncytium”; and that the semi-crystalline secretions of
calcium carbonate “were utilised by natural selection as ‘spicules’
for building up a skeleton, and afterwards, by the interaction of
adaptation and heredity, became modified in form and differentiated
in a vast variety of ways in the struggle for existence<a class="afnanch" href="#fn465" id="fnanch465">465</a>.”
What Haeckel precisely signified by these words is not clear to me.</p>

<p>F. E. Schultze, perceiving that identical forms of spicule were
developed whether the material were crystalline or non-crystalline,
abandoned all theories based upon cry­stal­li­sa­tion; he simply saw
in the form and arrangement of the spicules something which
was “best fitted” for its purpose, that is to say for the support
and strengthening of the porous walls of the sponge, and found
clear evidence of “utility” in the specific structure of these
skeletal elements. <span class="xxpn" id="p455">{455}</span></p>

<p>Sollas and Dreyer, as we have seen, introduced in various
ways the conception of physical causation,—as indeed Haeckel
himself had done in regard to one particular, when he supposed
the <i>position</i> of the spicules to be due to the constant passage of
the water-currents. Though even here, by the way, if I understand
Haeckel aright, he was thinking not merely of a direct or immediate
physical causation, but of one manifesting itself through
the agency of natural selection<a class="afnanch" href="#fn466" id="fnanch466">466</a>.
Sollas laid stress upon the “path
of least resistance” as determining the direction of growth;
while Dreyer dealt in greater detail with the various tensions
and pressures to which the growing spicule was exposed, amid
the alveolar or vesicular structure which was represented alike
by the chambers of the sponge, by the reticulum of constituent
cells, or by the minute structure of the intracellular protoplasm.
But neither of these writers, so far as I can discover, was inclined
to doubt for a moment the received canon of biology, which sees
in such structures as these the char­ac­teris­tics of true organic
species, and the indications of an hereditary affinity by which
blood-relationship and the succession of evolutionary descent
throughout geologic time can be ultimately deduced.</p>

<p>Lastly, Minchin, in a well-known paper<a class="afnanch" href="#fn467" id="fnanch467">467</a>,
took sides with
Schultze, and gave reasons for dissenting from such mechanical
theories as those of Sollas and of Dreyer. For example, after
pointing out that all protoplasm contains a number of “granules”
or microsomes, contained in the alveolar framework and lodged
at the nodes of the reticulum, he argued that these also ought to
acquire a form such as the spicules possess, if it were the case that
these latter owed their form to their very similar or identical
position. “If vesicular tension cannot in any other instance cause
the granules at the nodes to assume a tetraxon form, why should
it do so for the sclerites?” In all probability the answer to this
question is not far to seek. If the force which the “mechanical”
hypothesis has in view were simply that
of mechanical <i>pressure</i>, <span class="xxpn" id="p456">{456}</span>
as between solid bodies, then indeed we should expect that any
substances whatsoever, lying between the impinging spheres,
would tend (unless they were infinitely hard) to assume the
quadriradiate or “tetraxon” form; but this conclusion does not
follow at all, in so far as it is to <i>surface-energy</i> that we ascribe the
phenomenon. Here the specific nature of the substances involved
makes all the difference. We cannot argue from one substance
to another; adsorptive attraction shews its effect on one and not
on another; and we have not the least reason to be surprised if
we find that the little granules of protoplasmic material, which
as they lie bathed in the more fluid protoplasm have (presumably,
and as their shape indicates) a strong surface-tension of their
own, behave towards the adjacent vesicles in a very different
fashion to the incipient aggregations of calcareous or siliceous
matter in a colloid medium. “The ontogeny of the spicules,” says
Professor Minchin, “points clearly to their regular form being a
<i>phylogenetic adaptation, which has become fixed and handed on by
heredity, appearing in the ontogeny as a prophetic adaptation</i>.”
And again, “The forms of the spicules are the result of adaptation
to the requirements of the sponge as a whole, produced by <i>the
action of natural selection upon variation in every direction</i>.” It
would scarcely be possible to illustrate more briefly and more
cogently than by these few words (or the similar words of Haeckel
quoted on p. <a href="#p454" title="go to pg. 454">454</a>), the fundamental difference between the
Darwinian conception of the causation and determination of
Form, and that which is char­ac­ter­is­tic of the physical sciences.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>If I have dealt comparatively briefly with the inorganic
skeleton of sponges, in spite of the obvious importance of this
part of our subject from the physical or mechanical point of view,
it has been owing to several reasons. In the first place, though
the general trend of the phenomena is clear, it must be at once
admitted that many points are obscure, and could only be discussed
at the cost of a long argument. In the second place, the physical
theory is (as I have shewn) in manifest conflict with the accounts
given by various embryologists of the development of the spicules,
and of the current biological theories which their descriptions
embody; it is beyond our scope to deal
with such descriptions <span class="xxpn" id="p457">{457}</span>
in detail. Lastly, we find ourselves able to illustrate the same
physical principles with greater clearness and greater certitude in
another group of animals, namely the Radiolaria. In our description
of the skeletons occurring within this group we shall by no
means abandon the preliminary clas­si­fi­ca­tion of microscopic
skeletons which we have laid down; but we shall have occasion
to blend with it the consideration of certain other more or less
correlated phenomena.</p>

<p>The group of microscopic organisms known as the Radiolaria
is extraordinarily rich in diverse forms, or “species.” I do not
know how many of such species have been described and defined
by naturalists, but some thirty years ago the number was said
to be over four thousand, arranged in more than seven hundred
genera<a class="afnanch" href="#fn468" id="fnanch468">468</a>.
Of late years there has been a tendency to reduce the
number, it being found that some of the earlier species and even
genera are but growth-stages of one and the same form, sometimes
mere fragments or “fission-products” common to several species,
or sometimes forms so similar and so interconnected by intermediate
forms that the naturalist denominates them not “species”
but “varieties.” It has to be admitted, in short, that the conception
of species among the Radiolaria has not hitherto been,
and is not yet, on the same footing as that among most other
groups of animals. But apart from the extraordinary multiplicity
of forms among the Radiolaria, there are certain other features
in this multiplicity which arrest our attention. For instance,
the distribution of species in space is curious and vague; many
species are found all over the world, or at least every here and
there, with no evidence of specific limitations of geographical
habitat; others occur in the neighbourhood of the two poles;
some are confined to warm and others to cold currents of the
ocean. In time also their distribution is not less vague: so much
so that it has been asserted of them that “from the Cambrian
age downwards, the families and even genera appear identical
with those now living.” Lastly, except perhaps in the case of
a few large “colonial forms,” we seldom if ever
find, as is usual <span class="xxpn" id="p458">{458}</span>
in most animals, a local predominance of one particular species.
On the contrary, in a little pinch of deep-sea mud or of some fossil
“Radiolarian earth,” we shall probably find scores, and it may be
even hundreds, of different forms. Moreover, the radiolarian
skeletons are of quite extraordinary delicacy and complexity, in
spite of their minuteness and the comparative simplicity of the
“unicellular” organisms within which they grow; and these
complex conformations have a wonderful and unusual appearance
of geometric regularity. All these <i>general</i> con­si­de­ra­tions seem
such as to prepare us for the special need of some physical
hypothesis of causation. The little skeletal fabrics remind us of
such objects as snow-crystals (themselves almost endless in their
diversity), rather than of a collection of distinct animals, constructed
in apparent accordance with functional needs, and distributed
in accordance with their fitness for particular situations.
Nevertheless great efforts have been made of recent years to
attach “a biological meaning” to these elaborate structures;
and “to justify the hope that in time the utilitarian character
[of the skeleton] will be more completely recognised<a class="afnanch" href="#fn469" id="fnanch469">469</a>.”</p>

<p>In the majority of cases, the skeleton of the Radiolaria is
composed, like that of so many sponges, of silica; in one large
family, the Acantharia (and perhaps in some others), it is composed,
in great part at least, of a very unusual constituent, namely
strontium sulphate<a class="afnanch" href="#fn470" id="fnanch470">470</a>.
There is no fundamental or important
morphological character in which the shells formed of these two
constituents differ from one another; and in no case can the
chemical properties of these inorganic materials be said to influence
the form of the complex skeleton or shell, save only in this general
way that, by their rigidity and toughness, they may give rise to
a fabric far more delicate and slender than we find developed
among calcareous organisms.</p>

<p>A slight exception to this rule is found in the presence of true
crystals, which occur within the central
capsules of certain <span class="xxpn" id="p459">{459}</span>
Radiolaria, for instance the genus Collosphaera<a class="afnanch" href="#fn471" id="fnanch471">471</a>.
Johannes Müller
(whose knowledge and insight never fail to astonish us) remarked
that these were identical in form with crystals of celestine, a
sulphate of strontium and barium; and Bütschli’s discovery of
sulphates of strontium and of barium in kindred forms render it
all but certain that they are actually true crystals of celestine<a class="afnanch" href="#fn472" id="fnanch472">472</a>.</p>

<p>In its typical form, the Radiolarian body consists of a spherical
mass of protoplasm, around which, and separated from it by some
sort of porous “capsule,” lies a frothy mass, composed of protoplasm
honeycombed into a multitude of alveoli or vacuoles, filled
with a fluid which can scarcely differ much from sea-water<a class="afnanch" href="#fn473" id="fnanch473">473</a>.
According to their surface-tension conditions, these vacuoles may
appear more or less isolated and spherical, or joining together in
a “froth” of polygonal cells; and in the latter, which is the
commoner condition, the cells tend to be of equal size, and the
resulting polygonal meshwork beautifully regular. In many cases,
a large number of such simple individual organisms are associated
together, forming a floating colony, and it is highly probable that
many other forms, with whose scattered skeletons we are alone
acquainted, had in life formed part likewise of a colonial organism.</p>

<p>In contradistinction to the sponges, in which the skeleton
always begins as a loose mass of isolated spicules, which only in
a few exceptional cases (such as Euplectella and Farrea) fuse into
a continuous network, the char­ac­ter­is­tic feature of the Radiolarians
lies in the possession of a continuous skeleton, in the form of a
netted mesh or perforated lacework, sometimes however replaced
by and often associated with minute independent spicules. Before
we proceed to treat of the more complex skeletons, we may begin,
then, by dealing with these comparatively simple cases where
either the entire skeleton or a considerable part of it is represented,
not by a continuous fabric, but by a quantity of loose, separate
spicules, or aciculae, which seem, like the
spicules of Alcyonium, <span class="xxpn" id="p460">{460}</span>
to be developed as free and isolated formations or deposits,
precipitated in the colloid matrix, with no relation of form to
the cellular or vesicular boundaries. These simple acicular spicules
occupy a definite position in the organism. Sometimes, as for
instance among the fresh-water Heliozoa (e.g. Raphidiophrys), they
lie on the outer surface of the organism, and not infrequently
(when the spicules are few in number) they tend to collect round
the bases of the pseudopodia, or around the large radiating
spicules, or axial rays, in the cases where these latter are present.
When the spicules are thus localised around some prominent centre,
they tend to take up a position of symmetry in regard to it; instead
of forming a tangled or felted layer, they come to lie side by side,
in a radiating cluster round the focus. In other cases (as for
instance in the well-known Radiolarian <i>Aulacantha scolymantha</i>)
the felted layer of aciculae lies at some depth below the surface,
forming a sphere concentric with the entire spherical organism.
In either case, whether the layer of spicules be deep or be superficial,
it tends to mark a “surface of discontinuity,” a meeting
place between two distinct layers of protoplasm or between the
protoplasm and the water around; and it is obvious that, in either
case, there are manifestations of surface-energy at the boundary,
which cause the spicules to be retained there, and to take up their
position in its plane. The case is somewhat, though not directly,
analogous to that of a cirrus cloud,
which marks the place of a surface
of discontinuity in a stratified atmosphere.</p>

<div class="dleft dwth-e" id="fig218">
<img src="images/i460.png" width="336" height="407" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 218.</div></div>

<p>We have, then, to enquire what are the conditions which
shall, apart from gravity, confine an extraneous body to a
surface-film; and we may do this very simply, by considering
the surface-energy of the entire system. In Fig. <a href="#fig218" title="go to Fig. 218">218</a> we
have two fluids in contact with one another (let us call
them water and protoplasm), and a body (<i>b</i>) which may be
immersed in either, or may be restricted to the boundary
<span class="xxpn" id="p461">{461}</span> between. We have
here three possible “interfacial contacts” each with its own
specific surface-energy, per unit of surface area: namely,
that between our particle and the water (let us call it α),
that between the particle and the protoplasm (β), and that
between water and protoplasm (γ). When the body lies in the
boundary of the two fluids, let us say half in one and half in
the other, the surface-energies concerned are equivalent to
(<i>S</i>&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;2)α&#x202f;+&#x202f;(<i>S</i>&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;2)β;
but we must also remember that, by the presence of the
particle, a small portion (equal to its sectional area <i>s</i>)
of the original contact-surface between water and protoplasm
has been obliterated, and with it a proportionate quantity
of energy, equivalent to <i>s</i>γ, has been set free. When, on
the other hand, the body lies entirely within one or other
fluid, the surface-energies of the system (so far as we are
concerned) are equivalent to <span class="nowrap">
<i>S</i>α&#x202f;+&#x202f;<i>s</i>γ,</span> or <span class="nowrap">
<i>S</i>β&#x202f;+&#x202f;<i>s</i>γ,</span> as the case may be. According as α
be less or greater than β, the particle will have a tendency
to remain immersed in the water or in the protoplasm; but if <span class="nowrap">
(<i>S</i>&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;2)(α&#x202f;+&#x202f;β)&#x202f;−&#x202f;<i>s</i>γ</span>
be less than either <i>S</i>α or <i>S</i>β, then the condition of minimal
potential will be found when the particle lies, as we have
said, in the boundary zone, half in one fluid and half in the
other; and, if we were to attempt a more general solution of
the problem, we should evidently have to deal with possible
conditions of equi­lib­rium under which the necessary balance of
energies would be attained by the particle rising or sinking in
the boundary zone, so as to adjust the relative magnitudes of
the surface-areas concerned. It is obvious that this principle
may, in certain cases, help us to explain the position even
of a <i>radial</i> spicule, which is just a case where the surface
of the solid spicule is distributed between the fluids with a
minimal disturbance, or minimal replacement, of the original
surface of contact between the one fluid and the other.<br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<p>In like manner we may provide for the case (a common and
an important one) where the protoplasm “creeps up” the spicule,
covering it with a delicate film. In Acanthocystis we have
yet another special case, where the radial spicules plunge only
a certain distance into the protoplasm of the cell, being arrested
at a boundary-surface between an inner and an outer layer of
cytoplasm; here we have only to assume that there
is a tension <span class="xxpn" id="p462">{462}</span>
at this surface, between the two layers of protoplasm, sufficient
to balance the tensions which act directly on the spicule<a class="afnanch" href="#fn474" id="fnanch474">474</a>.</p>

<p>In various Acanthometridae, besides such typical characters
as the radial symmetry, the concentric layers of protoplasm, and
the capillary surfaces in which the outer, vacuolated protoplasm
is festooned upon the projecting radii, we have another curious
feature. On the surface of the protoplasm where it creeps up
the sides of the long radial spicules, we find a number of elongated
bodies, forming in each case one or several little groups, and
lying neatly arranged in parallel bundles. A Russian naturalist,
Schewiakoff, whose views have been accepted in the text-books,
tells us that these are muscular structures, serving to raise or
lower the conical masses of protoplasm about the radial spicules,
which latter serve as so many “tent-poles” or masts, on which
the protoplasmic membranes are hoisted up; and the little
elongated bodies are dignified with various names, such as
“myonemes” or “myophriscs,” in allusion to their supposed
muscular nature<a class="afnanch" href="#fn475" id="fnanch475">475</a>.
This explanation is by no means convincing.
To begin with, we have precisely similar festoons of protoplasm
in a multitude of other cases where the “myonemes” are lacking;
from their minute size (·006–·012 mm.) and the amount of contraction
they are said to be capable of, the myonemes can hardly
be very efficient instruments of traction; and further, for them
to act (as is alleged) for a specific purpose, namely the “hydrostatic
regulation” of the organism giving it power to sink or to swim,
would seem to imply a mechanism of action and of coordination
which is difficult to conceive in these minute and simple organisms.
The fact is (as it seems to me), that the whole method of explanation
is unnecessary. Just as the supposed “hauling up” of the
protoplasmic festoons is at once explained by capillary phenomena,
so also, in all probability, is the position and arrangement of
the little elongated bodies. Whatever the actual nature of these
bodies may be, whether they are truly portions of differentiated
protoplasm, or whether they are foreign bodies or spicular
structures (as bodies occupying a similar position in other cases
undoubtedly are), we can explain their
situation on the surface <span class="xxpn" id="p463">{463}</span>
of the protoplasm, and their arrangement around the radial
spicules, all on the principles of surface-tension&#xfeff;<a
class="afnanch" href="#fn476" id="fnanch476">476</a>.</p>

<p>This last case is not of the simplest; and I do not forget that
my explanation of it, which is wholly theoretical, implies a doubt
of Schewiakoff’s statements, which are founded on direct personal
observation. This I am none too willing to do; but whether it
be justly done in this case or not, I hold that it is in principle
justifiable to look with great suspicion upon a number of kindred
statements where it is obvious that the observer has left out of
account the purely physical aspect of the phenomenon, and all
the opportunities of simple explanation which the consideration
of that aspect might afford.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Whether it be wholly applicable to this particular and complex
case or no, our general theorem of the localisation and arrestment
of solid particles in a surface-film is of very great biological
importance; for on it depends the power displayed by many
little naked protoplasmic organisms of covering themselves with
an “agglutinated” shell. Sometimes, as in <i>Difflugia</i>, <i>Astrorhiza</i>
(Fig. <a href="#fig219" title="go to Fig. 219">219</a>) and others, this covering consists of sand-grains picked
up from the surrounding medium, and sometimes, on the other
hand, as in <i>Quadrula</i>, it consists of solid particles which are said
to arise, as inorganic deposits or concretions, within the protoplasm
itself, and which find their way outwards to a position of equi­lib­rium
in the surface-layer; and in both cases, the mutual capillary
attractions between the particles, confined to the boundary-layer
but enjoying a certain measure of freedom therein, tends to the
orderly arrangement of the particles one with another, and even
to the appearance of a regular “pattern” as the result of this
arrangement.</p>

 <i>Astrorhiza limicola</i> and <i>arenaria</i>. (From Brady’s
 <i>Challenger Monograph</i>.)</div></div>

<p>The “picking up” by the protoplasmic organism of a solid
particle with which “to build its house” (for it is hard to avoid
this customary use of anthropomorphic figures of speech, misleading
though they be), is a physical phenomenon kindred to that by which
an Amoeba “swallows” a particle of food. This latter process
has been reproduced or imitated in various
pretty experimental <span class="xxpn" id="p465">{465}</span>
ways. For instance, Rhumbler has shewn that if a thread of
glass be covered with shellac and brought near a drop of
chloroform suspended in water, the drop takes in the spicule,
robs it of its shellac covering, and then passes it out again<a class="afnanch" href="#fn477" id="fnanch477">477</a>.
It is all a question of relative surface-energies, leading to different
degrees of “adhesion” between the chloroform and the glass or
its covering. Thus it is that the Amoeba takes in the diatom,
dissolves off its proteid covering, and casts out the shell.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as the whole phenomenon depends on a distribution
of surface-energy, the amount of which is specific to certain
particular substances in contact with one another, we have no
difficulty in understanding the <i>selective action</i>, which is very often
a conspicuous feature in the phenomenon<a class="afnanch" href="#fn478" id="fnanch478">478</a>.
Just as some caddis-worms
make their houses of twigs, and others of shells and again
others of stones, so some Rhizopods construct their agglutinated
“test” out of stray sponge-spicules, or frustules of diatoms, or
again of tiny mud particles or of larger grains of sand. In all
these cases, we have apparently to deal
with differences in specific <span class="xxpn" id="p466">{466}</span>
surface-energies, and also doubtless with differences in the total
available amount of surface-energy in relation to gravity or other
extraneous forces. In my early student days, Wyville Thomson
used to tell us that certain deep-sea “Difflugias,” after constructing
a shell out of particles of the black volcanic sand common in parts
of the North Atlantic, finished it off with “a clean white collar”
of little grains of quartz. Even this phenomenon may be accounted
for on surface-tension principles, if we assume that the surface-energy
ratios have tended to change, either with the growth of
the protoplasm or by reason of external variation of temperature
or the like; and we are by no means obliged to attribute the
phenomenon to a manifestation of volition, or taste, or aesthetic
skill, on the part of the microscopic organism. Nor, when certain
Radiolaria tend more than others to attract into their own substance
diatoms and such-like foreign bodies, is it scientifically
correct to speak, as some text-books do, of species “in which
diatom selection has become <i>a regular habit</i>.” To do so is an
exaggerated misuse of anthropomorphic phraseology.</p>

<p>The formation of an “agglutinated” shell is thus seen to be
a purely physical phenomenon, and indeed a special case of a
more general physical phenomenon which has many other
important consequences in biology. For the shell to assume the
solid and permanent character which it acquires, for instance, in
Difflugia, we have only to make the additional assumption that
some small quantities of a cementing substance are secreted by
the animal, and that this substance flows or creeps by capillary
attraction between all the interstices of the little quartz grains,
and ends by binding them all firmly together. Rhumbler<a class="afnanch" href="#fn479" id="fnanch479">479</a>
has
shewn us how these agglutinated tests, of spicules or of sand-grains,
can be precisely imitated, and how they are formed with
greater or less ease, and greater or less rapidity, according to the
nature of the materials employed, that is to say, according to
the specific surface-tensions which are involved. For instance if
we mix up a little powdered glass with chloroform, and set a drop
of the mixture in water, the glass particles gather neatly round
the surface of the drop so quickly that the eye
cannot follow the <span class="xxpn" id="p467">{467}</span>
operation. If we perform the same experiment with oil and fine sand,
dropped into 70 per cent. alcohol, a still more beautiful artificial
Rhizopod shell is formed, but it takes some three hours to do.</p>

<p>It is curious that, just at the very time when Rhumbler was
thus demonstrating the purely physical nature of the Difflugian
shell, Verworn was studying the same and kindred organisms
from the older standpoint of an incipient psychology<a class="afnanch" href="#fn480" id="fnanch480">480</a>.
But, as
Rhumbler himself admits, Verworn was very careful not to overestimate
the apparent signs of volition, or selective choice, in the
little organism’s use of the material of its dwelling.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>This long parenthesis has led us away, for the time being,
from the subject of the Radiolarian skeleton, and to that subject
we must now return. Leaving aside, then, the loose and scattered
spicules, which we have sufficiently discussed, the more perfect
Radiolarian skeletons consist of a continuous and regular structure;
and the siliceous (or other inorganic) material of which this framework
is composed tends to be deposited in one or other of two
ways or in both combined: (1) in the form of long spicular axes,
usually conjoined at, or emanating from, the centre of the protoplasmic
body, and forming a symmetric radial system; (2) in the
form of a crust, developed in various ways, either on the outer
surface of the organism or in relation to the various internal
surfaces which separate its concentric layers or its component
vesicles. Not unfrequently, this superficial skeleton comes to
constitute a spherical shell, or a system of concentric or otherwise
associated spheres.</p>

<p>We have already learned that a great part of the body
of the Radiolarian, and especially that outer portion to
which Haeckel has given the name of the “calymma,” is
built up of a great mass of “vesicles,” forming a sort of
stiff</p>

froth, and equivalent in the physical sense (though
not nec­es­sar­i­ly in the bio­log­i­cal sense) to “cells,”
in­as­much as the little vesicles have their own well-defined
boun­daries, and their own sur­face phenomena. In short, all
that we have said of cell-sur­faces, and cell con­for­ma­tions,
in our dis­cus­sion of cells and of tissues, will apply
in like manner, and under ap­prop­ri­ate con­di­tions, to
these. In cer­tain cases, even in <span class="xxpn"
id="p468">{468}</span> so com­mon and sim­ple a one as the
vac­uo­lated sub­stance of an Ac­ti­no­sphae­rium, we may see a
very close re­sem­blance, or for­mal analogy, to an ordinary
cel­lu­lar or “paren­chy­ma­tous” tissue, in the close-packed
ar­range­ment and con­sequent con­fig­u­ra­tion of these ves­i­cles,
and even at times in a slight mem­bra­nous hardening
of their walls. Leidy has figured<a class="afnanch"
href="#fn481" id="fnanch481">481</a> some curious little
bodies, like small masses of con­sol­i­dated froth, which
seem to be nothing else than the dead and empty husks,
or filmy skeletons, of Ac­ti­no­sphae­rium. And Carnoy&#xfeff;<a
class="afnanch" href="#fn482" id="fnanch482">482</a> has
dem­on­strat­ed in cer­tain cell-nuclei an all but precisely
similar framework, of extreme delicacy and minuteness,
as the result of partial solidification of interstitial
matter in a close-packed system of alveoli (Fig. <a href="#fig220" title="go to Fig. 220">220</a>).<br
class="brclrfix" /></p>

<p>Let us now suppose that,
in our Radiolarian, the outer
surface of the animal is covered by a layer of froth-like vesicles,
uniform or nearly so in size. We know that their tensions will
tend to conform them into a “honeycomb,” or regular meshwork
of hexagons, and that the free end of each hexagonal prism will
be a little spherical cap. Suppose now that it be at the outer
surface of the protoplasm (that namely which is in contact with
the surrounding sea-water), that the siliceous particles have a
tendency to be secreted or adsorbed; it will at once follow that
they will show a tendency to aggregate in the grooves which
separate the vesicles, and the result will be the development of
a most delicate sphere composed of tiny rods arranged in a regular
hexagonal network (e.g. <i>Aulonia</i>). Such a
conformation is <span class="xxpn" id="p469">{469}</span>
extremely common, and among its many variants may be found
cases in which (e.g. <i>Actinomma</i>), the vesicles have</p>

some in which the hexagonal meshwork has been developed
not only on one outer surface, but at successive <span

system of concentric spheres. If the siliceous material
be not limited to the linear junctions of the cells, but
spread over a portion of the outer spherical surfaces or
caps, then we shall have the condition represented in Fig.
<a href="#fig223" title="go to Fig. 223">223</a> (<i>Ethmosphaera</i>), where the shell appears perforated
by circular instead of hexagonal apertures, and the
circular pores are set on slight spheroidal eminences; and,
interconnected with such types as this, we have others in
which the accumulating pellicles of skeletal matter have
extended from the edges into the substance of the boundary
walls</p>

<p>In one or two very simple forms, such as the fresh-water

of some organic, acanthin-like substance; and in some examples
of <i>Clathrulina</i> the chitinous lattice-work of the
shell is just as <span class="xxpn" id="p471">{471}</span>
regular and delicate, with the meshes just as beautifully hexagonal,
as in the siliceous shells of the oceanic Radiolaria. This is only
another proof (if proof be needed) that the peculiar conformation
of these little skeletons is not due to the material of which they
are composed, but to the moulding of that material upon an underlying
vesicular structure.</p>

<p>Let us next suppose that, upon some such lattice-work as has
just been described, another and external layer of cells or vesicles
is developed, and that instead of (or perhaps only in addition to)
a second hexagonal lattice-work, which might develop concentrically
to the first in the boundary-furrows of this new layer of
cells, the siliceous matter now tends to be deposited radially,
or normally to the surface of the sphere, just in the lines where
the external layer of vesicles meet one another, three by three.
The result will be that, when the vesicles themselves are removed,
a series of radiating spicules will be revealed, directed outwards
from each of the angles of the original hexagon; as is seen
in Fig. <a href="#fig225" title="go to Fig. 225">225</a>. And it may further happen that these radiating
skeletal rods are continued at their distal ends into divergent
rays, forming a triple fork, and cor­re­spon­ding
(after a fashion <span class="xxpn" id="p472">{472}</span>
which we have already described as occurring in certain sponge-spicules)
to the three superficial furrows between the adjacent
cells. This last is, as it were, an intermediate stage between the
simple rods and the complete formation of another concentric
sphere of latticed hexagons. Another possible case is when the
large and uniform vesicles of the outer protoplasm are mixed
with, or replaced by, much smaller vesicles, piled on one another
in more or less concentric layers; in this case the radiating</p>

with angles in three vertical planes, cor­re­spon­ding to the successive
contacts of the groups of cells around the axis (Fig. <a href="#fig226" title="go to Fig. 226">226</a>).</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Among a certain group called the Nassellaria, we find geometrical
forms of peculiar simplicity and beauty,—such for instance
as that which I have represented in Fig. <a href="#fig227" title="go to Fig. 227">227</a>. It is obvious at
a glance that this is such a skeleton as may
have been formed <span class="xxpn" id="p473">{473}</span>
(I think we may go so far as to say <i>must</i> have been formed) at
the interfaces of a little tetrahedral group of cells, the four equal
cells of the tetrahedron being in this particular case supplemented
by a little one in the centre of the system. We see, precisely as
in the internal boundary-system of an artificial group of four
soap-bubbles, the plane surfaces of contact, six in number; the
relation to one another of each triple set of interfacial planes,
meeting one another at equal angles of 120°; and finally the
relation of the four lines or edges of triple contact, which tend
(but for the little central vesicle) to meet at co-equal solid angles
in the centre of the system, all as we have described on p. <a href="#p318" title="go to pg. 318">318</a>.
In short, each triple-walled re-entrant angle of the little shell has
essentially the configuration (or a part thereof) of what we have
called a “Maraldi pyramid” in our account of the architecture of
the honeycomb, on p.
<a href="#p329" title="go to pg. 329">329</a>&#xfeff;<a

<p>There are still two or three remarkable or peculiar features in
this all but math­e­mat­i­cally perfect shell, and they are in part easy
and in part they seem more difficult of interpretation.</p>

<p>We notice that the amount of solid matter deposited in the
plane interfacial boundaries is greatly increased at the outer
margin of each boundary wall, where it merges or coincides with
the superficial furrow which separates the free, spherical surfaces
of the bubbles from one another; and we may sometimes find that,
along these edges, the skeleton remains complete and strong,
while it shows signs of imperfect development or of breaking
away over great part of the rest of the interfacial surfaces. In
this there is nothing anomalous, for we have already recognised
that it is at the edges or margins of the interfacial partition-walls
that the manifestation of surface-energy will tend to reach its
maximum. And just as we have seen that, in certain of our
“multicellular” spherical Radiolarians, it is
at the superficial <span class="xxpn" id="p474">{474}</span>
edges or borders of</p>

skeletal formation occurs (giving rise to the netted shell

in the case of such little aggregates of cells or vesicles
as the four-celled system of Callimitra, it may happen
that about the external boundary-<i>lines</i>, and not in the
interior boundary-<i>planes</i>, the whole of the skeletal
matter is aggregated. In Fig. <a href="#fig228" title="go to Fig. 228">228</a> we see a curious little
skeletal structure or complex spicule, whose
conformation is easily accounted for
after this<br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<p class="pcontinue"> fashion. Little spicules such as this form
isolated portions of the skeleton in the genus <i>Dictyocha</i>,
and occur scattered over the spherical surface of the
organism (Fig. <a href="#fig229" title="go to Fig. 229">229</a>). The more or less basket-shaped spicule
has evidently been developed about a little cluster of
four cells or vesicles, lying in or on the plane of the
surface of the organism, and therefore arranged, not in
the tetrahedral form of Callimitra, but in the manner in
which four contiguous cells lying side by side normally set
themselves, like the four cells of a segmenting egg: that
is to say with an intervening “polar furrow,” whose ends
mark the meeting place, at equal angles, of the cells in
groups of three.</p>

<p>The little projecting spokes, or spikes, which are set normally
to the main basket-work, seem to be incompleted portions of
a larger basket, or in other words imperfectly formed elements
cor­re­spon­ding to the interfacial contacts in
the surrounding parts <span class="xxpn" id="p475">{475}</span>
of the system. Similar but more complex formations, all explicable
as basket-like frameworks developed around a cluster of cells, are
known in great variety.</p>

<p>In our Nassellarian itself, and in many other cases where the
plane interfacial boundary-walls are skeletonised, we see that the
siliceous matter is not deposited in an even and continuous layer,
like the waxen walls of a bee’s cell, but constitutes a meshwork
of fine curvilinear threads; and the curves seem to run, on the
whole, isogonally, and to form three main series, one ap­prox­i­mate­ly
parallel to, or concentric with, the outer or free edge of
the partition, and the other two related severally to its two edges
of attachment. Sometimes (as may also be seen in our figure),
the system is still further complicated by a fourth series of linear
elements, which tend to run radially from the centre of the system
to the free edge of each partition. As regards the former, their
arrangement is such as would result if deposition or solidification
had proceeded in waves, starting independently from each of the
three boundaries of the little partition-wall; and something of
this kind is doubtless what has happened. We are reminded at
once of the wave-like periodicity of the Liesegang phenomenon.
But apart from this we might conceive of other explanations.
For instance, the liquid film which originally constitutes the
partition must easily be thrown into <i>vibrations</i>, and (like the dust
upon a Chladni’s plate) minute particles of matter in contact with
the film would tend to take up their position in a symmetrical
arrangement, in direct relation to the nodal points or lines of the
vibrating surface<a class="afnanch" href="#fn485" id="fnanch485">485</a>.
Some such explanation as this (to my thinking)
must be invoked to account for the minute and varied and very
beautiful patterns upon many diatoms, the resemblance of which
patterns (in certain of their simpler cases) to the Chladni figures
is sometimes striking and obvious. But the many special problems
which the diatom skeleton suggests I have not attempted
to consider.</p>

<div class="dctr02" id="fig230">
<img src="images/i476.png" width="704" height="309" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 230.</div></div>

<p>The last peculiarity of our Nassellarian lies in an
apparent departure from what we should at first expect in
the way of its <span class="xxpn" id="p476">{476}</span>
external symmetry. Were the system actually composed of four
spherical vesicles in mutual contact, the outer margin of each of
the six interfacial planes would obviously be a circular arc; and
accordingly, at each angle of the tetrahedron, we should expect
to have a depressed, or re-entrant angle, instead of a prominent
cusp. This is all doubtless due to some simple balance of tensions,
whose precise nature and distribution is meanwhile a matter of
conjecture. But it seems as though an extremely simple explanation
would go a long way, and possibly the whole way, to meet
this particular case. In our ordinary plane diagram of three cells,
or soap-bubbles, in contact, we know (and we have just said)
that the tensions of the three partitions draw inwards the outer
walls of the system, till at each point of triple contact (<i>P</i>) we tend
to get a triradiate, equiangular junction. But if we introduce
another bubble into the centre of the system (Fig. <a href="#fig230" title="go to Fig. 230">230</a>), then, as
Plateau shewed, the tensions of its walls and those of the three
partitions by which it is now suspended, again balance one
another, and the central bubble appears (in plane projection) as
a curvilinear, equilateral triangle. We have only got to convert
this plane diagram into that of a tetrahedral solid to obtain <i>almost</i>
precisely the configuration which we are seeking to explain.
Now we observe that, so far as our figure of Callimitra informs
us, this is just the shape of the little bubble which occupies the
centre of the tetrahedral system in that Radiolarian skeleton.
And I conceive, accordingly, that the entire organism was not
limited to the four cells or vesicles (together with
the little central <span class="xxpn" id="p477">{477}</span>
fifth) which we have hitherto been imagining, but there must have
been an outer tetrahedral system, enclosing the cells which fabricated
the skeleton, just as these latter enclosed, and deformed,
the little bubble in the centre of all. We have only to suppose
that this hypothetical tetrahedral series, forming the outer layer or
surface of the whole system, was for some chemico-physical reason
incapable of secreting at its interfacial contacts a skeletal fabric<a class="afnanch" href="#fn486" id="fnanch486">486</a>.</p>

<p>In this hypothetical case, the edges of the skeletal system would
be circular arcs, meeting one another at an angle of 120°, or, in the
solid pyramid, of 109°: and this latter is <i>very nearly</i> the condition
which our little skeleton actually displays. But we observe in
Fig. <a href="#fig227" title="go to Fig. 227">227</a> that, in the immediate neighbourhood of the tetrahedral
angle, the circular arcs are slightly drawn out into projecting
cusps (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig230" title="go to Fig. 230">230</a>, <i>B</i>). There is
no <span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-a"
src="images/glyph-s.png" width="32" height="46" alt="S" />-shaped</span>
curvature of the
tetrahedral edges as a whole, but a very slight one, a very slight
change of curvature; close to the apex. This, I conceive, is
nothing more than what, in a material system, we are bound to
have, to represent a “surface of continuity.” It is a phenomenon
precisely analogous to Plateau’s “bourrelet,” which we have
already seen to be a constant feature of all cellular systems,
rounding off the sharp angular contacts by which (in our more
elementary treatment) we expect one film to make its junction
with another<a class="afnanch" href="#fn487" id="fnanch487">487</a>.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>In the foregoing examples of Radiolaria, the symmetry which
the organism displays would seem to be identical with that
symmetry of forces which is due to the assemblage of surface-tensions
in the whole system; this symmetry being displayed, in
one class of cases, in a complex spherical mass
of froth, and in <span class="xxpn" id="p478">{478}</span>
another class in a simpler aggregate of a few, otherwise isolated,
vesicles. But among the vast number of other known Radiolaria,
there are certain forms (especially among the Phaeodaria and
Acantharia) which display a still more remarkable symmetry, the
origin of which is by no means clear, though surface-tension
doubtless plays a part in its causation. These are cases in which
(as in some of those already described) the skeleton consists
(1) of radiating spicular rods, definite in number and position,
and (2) of interconnecting rods or plates, tangential to the more
or less spherical body of the organism, whose form becomes,
accordingly, that of a geometric, polyhedral solid. It may be
that there is no math­e­mat­i­cal difference, save one of degree,
between such a hexagonal polyhedron as we have seen in <i>Aulacantha</i>,
and those which we are about to describe; but the greater
regularity, the numerical symmetry, and the apparent simplicity
of these latter, makes of them a class apart, and suggests problems
which have not been solved nor even investigated.</p>

<p>The matter is sufficiently illustrated by the
accompanying figures, all drawn from Haeckel’s Monograph of
the Challenger Radiolaria<a class="afnanch" href="#fn488"
id="fnanch488">488</a>. In one of these we see a
regular octahedron, in another a regular, or pentagonal
dodecahedron, in a third a regular icosahedron. In all
cases the figure appears to be perfectly symmetrical,
though neither the triangular facets of the octahedron and
icosahedron, nor the pentagonal facets of the dodecahedron,
are necessarily plane surfaces. In all of these cases,
the radial spicules correspond to the solid angles of the
figure; and they are, accordingly, six in number in the
octahedron, twenty in the dodecahedron, and twelve in the
icosahedron. If we add to these three figures the regular
tetrahedron, which we have had frequent occasion to study,
and the cube (which is represented, at least in outline,
in the skeleton of the hexactinellid sponges), we have
completed the series of the five regular polyhedra known
to geometers, the <i>Platonic bodies</i><a class="afnanch"
href="#fn489" id="fnanch489">489</a> of the older
mathematicians. It is</p>

<p class="pcontinue">at first sight all the more remarkable that
we should here meet <span class="xxpn" id="p480">{480}</span>
with the whole five regular polyhedra, when we remember that,
among the vast variety of crystalline forms known among minerals,
the regular dodecahedron and icosahedron, simple as they are
from the math­e­mat­i­cal point of view, never occur. Not only do
these latter never occur in Crys­tal­log­raphy, but (as is explained
in text-books of that science) it has been shewn that they cannot
occur, owing to the fact that their indices (or numbers expressing
the relation of the faces to the three primary axes) involve an
irrational quantity: whereas it is a fundamental law of crys­tal­log­raphy,
involved in the whole theory of space-partitioning, that
“the indices of any and every face of a crystal are small whole
numbers<a class="afnanch" href="#fn490" id="fnanch490">490</a>.”
At the same time, an imperfect pentagonal dodecahedron,
whose pentagonal sides are non-equilateral, is common
among crystals. If we may safely judge from Haeckel’s figures,
the pentagonal dodecahedron of the Radiolarian is perfectly
regular, and we must presume, accordingly, that it is not brought
about by principles of space-partitioning similar to those which
manifest themselves in the phenomenon of cry­stal­li­sa­tion. It
will be observed that in all these radiolarian polyhedral shells,
the surface of each external facet is formed of a minute hexagonal
network, whose probable origin, in relation to a vesicular
structure, is such as we have already discussed.</p>

<p>In certain allied Radiolaria (Fig. <a href="#fig232" title="go to Fig. 232">232</a>), which, like the dodecahedral
form figured in Fig. <a href="#fig231" title="go to Fig. 231">231</a>, 5, have twenty radial spines, these
latter are commonly described as being arranged in a certain very
singular way. It is stated that their arrangement
may be referred <span class="xxpn" id="p481">{481}</span>
to a series of five parallel circles on the sphere, cor­re­spon­ding to the
equator (<i>c</i>), the tropics (<i>b</i>, <i>d</i>) and the polar circles (<i>a</i>, <i>e</i>); and that
beginning with four equidistant spines in the equator, we have
alternating whorls of four, radiating outwards from the sphere in
each of the other parallel zones. This rule was laid down by the
celebrated Johannes Müller, and has ever since been used and
quoted as Müller’s law. The chief point in this alleged arrangement
which strikes us at first sight as very curious, is that there
is said to be no spine at either pole; and when we come to examine
carefully the figure of the organism, we find that the received</p>

 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 232. <i>Dorataspis</i> sp.;
 diagrammatic.</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">description does not do justice to the facts. We see, in the first
place, from such figures as Figs. <a href="#fig232" title="go to Fig. 232">232</a>, 234, that here, unlike our
former cases, the radial spines issue through the facets (and through
<i>all</i> the facets) of the polyhedron, instead of through its solid angles;
and accordingly, that our twenty spines correspond (not, as before,
to a dodecahedron) but to some sort of an icosahedron. We see
in the next place, that this icosahedron is composed of faces, or
plates, of two different kinds, some hexagonal and some pentagonal;
and when we look closer, we discover that the whole
figure is that of a hexagonal prism, whose twelve solid angles are
replaced by pentagonal facets. Both
hexagons and pentagons <span class="xxpn" id="p482">{482}</span>
appear to be perfectly equilateral, but if we try to construct a
plane-sided polyhedron of this kind, we soon find that it is
impossible; for into the angles between the six equatorial hexagons
those of the six united pentagons will not fit. The figure however
can be easily constructed if we replace the straight edges (or some
of them) by curves, and the plane facets by cor­re­spon­ding, slightly
curved, surfaces. The true symmetry of this figure, then, is
hexagonal, with a polar axis, produced into two polar spicules;
with six equatorial spicules, or rays; and with two sets of six
spicular rays, interposed between the polar axis and the equatorial
rays, and alternating in position with the latter.</p>

<div class="psmprnt3">
<p>Müller’s description was emended by Brandt, and what is now known as
“Brandt’s law,” viz. that the symmetry consists of two polar rays, and three
whorls of six each, coincides with the above description so far as the spicular
axes go: save only that Brandt specifically states that the intermediate
whorls stand equidistant between the equator and the poles, i.e. in latitude 45°.
While not far from the truth, this statement is not exact; for according to
the geometry of the figure, the intermediate cycles obviously stand in a slightly
higher latitude, but this latitude I have not attempted to determine; for
the calculation seems to be a little troublesome owing to the curvature of
the sides of the figure, and the enquiring mathematician will perform it more
easily than I. Brandt, if I understand him rightly, did not propose his
“law” as a substitute for Müller’s law, but as a second law applicable to a few
particular cases. I on the other hand can find no case to which Müller’s law
properly applies.</p>
</div><!--psmprnt3-->

<p>If we construct such a polyhedron, and set it in the position
of Fig. <a href="#fig232" title="go to Fig. 232">232</a>, <i>B</i>, we shall easily see that it is capable of explanation
(though improperly) in accordance with Müller’s law; for the
four equatorial rays of Müller (<i>c</i>) now correspond to the two polar
and to two opposite equatorial facets of our polyhedron: the
four “polar” rays of Müller (<i>a</i> or <i>e</i>) correspond to two adjacent
hexagons and two intermediate pentagons of the figure: and
Müller’s “tropical” rays (<i>b</i> or <i>d</i>) are those which emanate from the
remaining four pentagonal facets, in each half of the figure. In
some cases, such as Haeckel’s <i>Phatnaspis cristata</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig233" title="go to Fig. 233">233</a>), we
have an ellipsoidal body, from which the spines emerge in the
order described, but which is not obviously divided by facets.
In Fig. <a href="#fig234" title="go to Fig. 234">234</a> I have indicated the facets cor­re­spon­ding to the rays,
and dividing the surface in the
usual symmetrical way. <span class="xxpn" id="p483">{483}</span></p>

<p>Within any polyhedron we may always inscribe another
polyhedron, whose corners correspond in number to the sides or
facets of the original figure, or (in alternative cases) to a certain
number of these sides; and a similar result is obtained by bevelling
off the corners of the original polyhedron. We may obtain a
precisely similar symmetrical result if (in such a case as these
Radiolarians which we are describing), we imagine the radial
spines to be interconnected by tangential rods, instead of by the
complete facets which we have just been dealing with. In our
complicated polyhedron with its twenty radial spines arranged in
the manner described there are various symmetrical ways in which
we may imagine these interconnecting bars to be arranged. The
most symmetrical of these is one in which the whole surface is
divided into eighteen rhomboidal areas, obtained by systematically
connecting each group of four adjacent radii. This figure has
eighteen faces (<i>F</i>), twenty corners (<i>C</i>), and therefore thirty-six
edges (<i>E</i>), in conformity with Euler’s theorem, <i>F</i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;<i>C</i>
=&#x202f;<i>E</i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;2.</p>

<p>In all these latter cases it is the arrangement of the axial
rods, or in other words the “polar symmetry” of the entire
organism, which lies at the root of the matter, and
which, if only <span class="xxpn" id="p485">{485}</span>
we could account for it, would make it comparatively easy to
explain the superficial configuration. But there are no obvious
mechanical forces by which we can so explain this peculiar
polarity. This at least is evident, that it arises in the central
mass of protoplasm, which is the essential living portion of the
organism as distinguished from that frothy peripheral mass whose
structure has helped us to explain so many phenomena of the
superficial or external skeleton. To say that the arrangement
depends upon a specific polarisation of the cell is merely to refer
the problem to other terms, and to set it aside for future solution.
But it is possible that we may learn something about the lines in
which <i>to seek for</i> such a solution by considering the case of
Lehmann’s “fluid crystals,” and the light which they throw upon
the phenomena of molecular aggregation.</p>

<p>The phenomenon of “fluid cry­stal­li­sa­tion” is found in a
number of chemical bodies; it is exhibited at a specific temperature
for each substance; and it would seem to be limited to bodies
in which there is a more or less elongated, or “chain-like” arrangement
of the atoms in the molecule. Such bodies, at the appropriate
temperature, tend to aggregate themselves into masses, which are
sometimes spherical drops or globules (the so-called “spherulites”),
and sometimes have the definite form of needle-like or prismatic
crystals. In either case they remain liquid, and are also doubly
refractive, polarising light in brilliant colours. Together with
them are formed ordinary solid crystals, also with char­ac­ter­is­tic
polarisation, and into such solid crystals all the fluid material
ultimately turns. It is evident that in these liquid crystals,
though the molecules are freely mobile, just as are those of water,
they are yet subject to, or endowed with, a “directive force,”
a force which confers upon them a definite configuration or
“polarity,” the <i>Gestaltungskraft</i> of Lehmann.</p>

<p>Such an hypothesis as this had been gradually extruded from
the theories of math­e­mat­i­cal crys­tal­log­raphy<a class="afnanch" href="#fn491" id="fnanch491">491</a>;
and it had come
to be believed that the symmetrical conformation of a homogeneous
crystalline structure was sufficiently explained by the
mere mechanical fitting together of appropriate structural units
along the easiest and simplest lines of “close
packing”: just as <span class="xxpn" id="p486">{486}</span>
a pile of oranges becomes definite, both in outward form and
inward structural arrangement, without the play of any <i>specific</i>
directive force. But while our conceptions of the tactical arrangement
of crystalline molecules remain the same as before, and our
hypotheses of “modes of packing” or of “space-lattices” remain
as useful as ever for the definition and explanation of the
molecular arrangements, an entirely new theoretical conception
is introduced when we find such space-lattices maintained in
what has hitherto been considered the molecular freedom of a
liquid field; and we are constrained, accordingly, to postulate
a specific molecular force, or “Gestaltungskraft” (not unlike
Kepler’s “facultas formatrix”), to account for the phenomenon.</p>

<p>Now just as some sort of specific “Gestaltungskraft” had
been of old the <i>deus ex machina</i> accounting for all crystalline
phenomena (<i>gnara totius geometriæ, et in ea exercita</i>, as Kepler
said), and as such an hypothesis, after being dethroned and
repudiated, has now fought its way back and has made good its
right to be heard, so it may be also in biology. We begin by an
easy and general assumption of <i>specific properties</i>, by which each
organism assumes its own specific form; we learn later (as it is
the purpose of this book to shew) that throughout the whole
range of organic morphology there are innumerable phenomena of
form which are not peculiar to living things, but which are more
or less simple manifestations of ordinary physical law. But every
now and then we come to certain deep-seated signs of protoplasmic
symmetry or polarisation, which seem to lie beyond the
reach of the ordinary physical forces. It by no means follows
that the forces in question are not essentially physical forces, more
obscure and less familiar to us than the rest; and this would seem
to be the crucial lesson for us to draw from Lehmann’s surprising
and most beautiful discovery. For Lehmann seems actually to
have demonstrated, in non-living, chemical bodies, the existence
of just such a determinant, just such a “Gestaltungskraft,” as
would be of infinite help to us if we might postulate it for the
explanation (for instance) of our Radiolarian’s axial symmetry.
But further than this we cannot go; for such analogy as we seem
to see in the Lehmann phenomenon soon evades us, and refuses
to be pressed home. Not only is it the case, as
we have already <span class="xxpn" id="p487">{487}</span>
seen, that certain of the geometric forms assumed by the symmetrical
Radiolarian shells are just such as the “space-lattice”
theory would seem to be inapplicable to, but it is in other ways
obvious that symmetry of <i>cry­stal­li­sa­tion</i>, whether liquid or solid,
has no close parallel, but only a series of analogies, in the protoplasmic
symmetry of the living cell.</p>

A PARENTHETIC NOTE ON GEODETICS</span></h2></div>

<p>We have made use in the last chapter of the math­e­mat­i­cal
principle of Geodetics (or Geodesics) in order to explain the conformation
of a certain class of sponge-spicules; but the principle
is of much wider application in morphology, and would seem to
deserve attention which it has not yet received.</p>

 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 236. Annular and spiral thickenings
 in the walls of plant-cells.</div></div>

<p>Defining, meanwhile, our geodetic line (as we have
already done) as the shortest distance between two points
on the surface of a solid of revolution, we find that the
geodetics of the cylinder give us one of the simplest of
cases. Here it is plain that the geodetics are of three
kinds: (1) a series of annuli around the cylinder, that
is to say, a system of circles, in planes parallel to one
another and at right angles to the axis of the cylinder
(Fig. <a href="#fig236" title="go to Fig. 236">236</a>, <i>a</i>); (2) a series of straight lines parallel to
the axis; and (3) a series of spiral curves winding round
the wall of the cylinder (<i>b</i>, <i>c</i>). These three systems
are all of frequent occurrence, and are all illustrated in
the local thickenings of the wall of the cylindrical cells
or vessels of plants. <br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<p>The spiral, or rather helicoid, geodetic is particularly common
in cylindrical structures, and is beautifully shewn for instance in
the spiral coil which stiffens the tracheal tubes of an insect, or
the so-called “tracheides” of a woody
stem. A similar <span class="xxpn" id="p489">{489}</span>
phenomenon is often witnessed in the splitting of a glass tube. If a
crack appear in a thin tube, such as a test-tube, it has a tendency
to be prolonged in its own direction, and the more perfectly
homogeneous and isotropic be the glass the more evenly will the
split tend to follow the straight course in which it began. As
a result, the crack in our test-tube is often seen to continue till
the tube is split into a continuous spiral ribbon.</p>

<p>In a right cone, the spiral geodetic falls into closer and closer
coils as the diameter of the cone narrows; and a very beautiful
geodetic of this kind is exemplified in the sutural line of a spiral
shell, such as Turritella, or in the striations which run parallel
with the spiral suture. Similarly, in an ellipsoidal surface, we
have a spiral geodetic, whose coils get closer together as we
approach the ends of the long axis of the ellipse; in the splitting
of the integument of an Equisetum-spore, by which are formed
the spiral “elaters” of the spore, we have a case of this kind,
though the spiral is not sufficiently prolonged to shew all its
features in detail.</p>

<p>We have seen in these various cases, that our original definition
of a geodetic requires to be modified; for it is only subject to
conditions that it is “the shortest distance between two points
on the surface of the solid,” and one of the commonest of these
restricting conditions is that our geodetic may be constrained to
go twice, or many times, round the surface on its way. In short,
we must redefine our geodetic, as a curve drawn upon a surface,
such that, if we take any two <i>adjacent</i> points on the curve,
the curve gives the shortest distance between them. Again,
in the geodetic systems which we meet with in morphology, it
sometimes happens that we have two opposite systems of geodetic
spirals separate and distinct from one another, as in Fig. <a href="#fig236" title="go to Fig. 236">236</a>, <i>c</i>;
and it is also common to find the two systems interfering with
one another, and forming a criss-cross, or reticulated arrangement.
This is a very common source of reticulated patterns.</p>

<p>Among the ciliated Infusoria, we have in the spiral lines along
which their cilia are arranged a great variety of beautiful geodetic
curves; though it is probable enough that in some complicated
cases these are not simple geodetics, but projections of curves
other than a straight line upon the surface
of the solid. <span class="xxpn" id="p490">{490}</span></p>

<p>Lastly, a very instructive case is furnished by the arrangement
of the muscular fibres on the surface of a hollow organ, such as
the heart or the stomach. Here we may consider the phenomenon
from the point of view of mechanical efficiency, as well as from
that of purely descriptive or objective anatomy. In fact we have
an <i>a priori</i> right to expect that the muscular fibres covering such
hollow or tubular organs will coincide with geodetic lines, in the
sense in which we are now using the term. For if we imagine a
contractile fibre, or elastic band, to be fixed by its two ends upon
a curved surface, it is obvious that its first effort of contraction
will tend to expend itself in accommodating the band to the
form of the surface, in “stretching it tight,” or in other words
in causing it to assume a direction which is the shortest possible
line <i>upon the surface</i> between the two extremes: and it is only
then that further contraction will have the effect of constricting
the tube and so exercising pressure on its contents. Thus the
muscular fibres, as they wind over the curved surface of an organ,
arrange themselves automatically in geodesic curves: in precisely
the same manner as we also automatically construct complex
systems of geodesics whenever we wind a ball of wool or a spindle
of tow, or when the skilful surgeon bandages a limb. In these
latter cases we see the production of those “figures-of-eight,” to
which, in the case for instance of the heart-muscles, Pettigrew
and other anatomists have ascribed peculiar importance. In the
case of both heart and stomach we must look upon these organs
as developed from a simple cylindrical tube, after the fashion of
the glass-blower, as is further discussed on p. <a href="#p737" title="go to pg. 737">737</a> of this book,
the modification of the simple cylinder consisting of various degrees
of dilatation and of twisting. In the primitive undistorted
cylinder, as in an artery or in the intestine, the muscular fibres
run in geodetic lines, which as a rule are not spiral, but are merely
either annular or longitudinal; these are the ordinary “circular
and longitudinal coats,” which form the normal musculature of
all tubular organs, or of the body-wall of a cylindrical worm<a class="afnanch" href="#fn492" id="fnanch492">492</a>.
If
we consider each muscular fibre as an elastic strand, imbedded in
the elastic membrane which constitutes the wall
of the organ, it <span class="xxpn" id="p491">{491}</span>
is evident that, whatever be the distortion suffered by the entire
organ, the individual fibre will follow the same course, which will
still, in a sense, be a geodetic. But if the distortion be considerable,
as for instance if the tube become bent upon itself, or if at
some point its walls bulge outwards in a diverticulum or pouch,
it is obvious that the old system of geodetics will only mark the
shortest distance between two points more or less ap­prox­i­mate to
one another, and that new systems of geodetics will tend to
appear, peculiar to the new surface, and linking up points more
remote from one another. This is evidently the case in the
human stomach. We still have the systems, or their unobliterated
remains, of circular and longitudinal muscles; but we also see
two new systems of fibres, both obviously geodetic (or rather,
when we look more closely, both parts of one and the same
geodetic system), in the form of annuli encircling the pouch or
diverticulum at the cardiac end of the stomach, and of oblique
fibres taking a spiral course from the neighbourhood of the
oesophagus over the sides of the organ.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>In the heart we have a similar, but more complicated
phenomenon. Its musculature consists, in great part, of the
original simple system of circular and longitudinal muscles
which enveloped the original arterial tubes, which tubes, after
a process of local thickening, expansion, and especially <i>twisting</i>,
came together to constitute the composite, or double, mammalian
heart; and these systems of muscular fibres, geodetic to begin
with, remain geodetic (in the sense in which we are using the
word) after all the twisting to which the primitive cylindrical tube
or tubes have been subjected. That is to say, these fibres still
run their shortest possible course, from start to finish, over the
complicated curved surface of the organ; and it is only because
they do so that their contraction, or longitudinal shortening, is
able to produce its direct effect, as Borelli well understood, in
the contraction or systole of the heart<a class="afnanch" href="#fn493" id="fnanch493">493</a>.
<span class="xxpn" id="p492">{492}</span></p>

<p>As a parenthetic corollary to the case of the spiral pattern
upon the wall of a cylindrical cell, we may consider for a
moment the spiral line which many small organisms tend to
follow in their path of locomotion<a class="afnanch" href="#fn494" id="fnanch494">494</a>.
The helicoid spiral, traced
around the wall of our cylinder, may be explained as a composition
of two velocities, one a uniform velocity in the direction of the
axis of the cylinder, the other a uniform velocity in a circle
perpendicular to the axis. In a somewhat analogous fashion, the
smaller ciliated organisms, such as the ciliate and flagellate
Infusoria, the Rotifers, the swarm-spores of various Protists, and
so forth, have a tendency to combine a direct with a revolving
path in their ordinary locomotion. The means of locomotion
which they possess in their cilia are at best somewhat primitive
and inefficient; they have no apparent means of steering, or
modifying their direction; and, if their course tended to swerve
ever so little to one side, the result would be to bring them round
and round again in an ap­prox­i­mate­ly circular path (such as a man
astray on the prairie is said to follow), with little or no progress
in a definite longitudinal direction. But as a matter of fact,
either through the direct action of their cilia or by reason of a
more or less unsymmetrical form of the body, all these creatures
tend more or less to <i>rotate</i> about their long axis while they swim.
And this axial rotation, just as in the case of a rifle-bullet, causes
their natural swerve, which is always in the same direction as
regards their own bodies, to be in a continually changing direction
as regards space: in short, to make a spiral course around, and
more or less ap­prox­i­mate to, a straight axial line.</p>

THE LOGARITHMIC SPIRAL</span></h2></div>

<p>The very numerous examples of spiral conformation which we
meet with in our studies of organic form are peculiarly adapted
to math­e­mat­i­cal methods of in­ves­ti­ga­tion. But ere we begin to
study them, we must take care to define our terms, and we had
better also attempt some rough preliminary clas­si­fi­ca­tion of the
objects with which we shall have to deal.</p>

<p>In general terms, a Spiral Curve is a line which, starting from
a point of origin, continually diminishes in curvature as it recedes
from that point; or, in other words, whose <i>radius of curvature</i>
continually increases. This definition is wide enough to include
a number of different curves, but on the other hand it excludes
at least one which in popular speech we are apt to confuse with
a true spiral. This latter curve is the simple Screw, or cylindrical
Helix, which curve, as is very evident, neither starts from a definite
origin, nor varies in its curvature as it proceeds. The “spiral”
thickening of a woody plant-cell, the “spiral” thread within an
insect’s tracheal tube, or the “spiral” twist and twine of a climbing
stem are not, math­e­mat­i­cally speaking, <i>spirals</i> at all, but <i>screws
or helices</i>. They belong to a distinct, though by no means very
remote, family of curves. Some of these helical forms we have
just now treated of, briefly and parenthetically, under the subject
of Geodetics.</p>

<p>Of true organic spirals we have no lack&#xfeff;<a
class="afnanch" href="#fn495" id="fnanch495">495</a>.
We think at once of the beautiful spiral curves of the
horns of ruminants, and of the still more varied, if not
more beautiful, spirals of molluscan shells. Closely
related spirals may be traced in the arrangement <span
class="xxpn" id="p494">{494}</span> of the florets in
the sunflower; a true spiral, though not, by the way, so
easy of in­ves­ti­ga­tion, is presented to us by the outline
of a cordate leaf; and yet again, we can recognise
typical though transitory spirals in the coil of an
elephant’s trunk, in the “circling <span class="xxpn"
id="p495">{495}</span> spires” of a snake, in the coils
of a cuttle-fish’s arm, or of a monkey’s or a chameleon’s
tail.</p>

<p>Among such forms as these, and the many others which we
might easily add to them, it is obvious that we have to do with
things which, though math­e­mat­i­cally similar, are biologically
speaking fundamentally different. And not only are they biologically
remote, but they are also physically different, in regard
to the nature of the forces to which they are severally due. For
in the first place, the spiral coil of the elephant’s trunk or of the
chameleon’s tail is, as we have said, but a transitory configuration,
and is plainly the result of certain muscular forces acting upon
a structure of a definite, and normally an essentially different,
form. It is rather a position, or an <i>attitude</i>, than a <i>form</i>, in the
sense in which we have been using this latter term; and, unlike
most of the forms which we have been studying, it has little or no
direct relation to the phenomenon of Growth.</p>

<img src="images/i495.png" width="608" height="257" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 238. A Foraminiferal
 shell (Globigerina).</div></div>

<p>Again, there is a manifest and not unimportant difference
between such a spiral conformation as is built up by the separate
and successive florets in the sunflower, and that which, in the
snail or Nautilus shell, is apparently a single and indivisible unit.
And a similar, if not identical difference is apparent between the
Nautilus shell and the minute shells of the Foraminifera, which
so closely simulate it; inasmuch as the spiral shells of these latter
are essentially composite structures, combined out of successive
and separate chambers, while the molluscan shell, though it may
(as in Nautilus) become secondarily subdivided, has grown as
one continuous tube. It follows from all this
that there cannot <span class="xxpn" id="p496">{496}</span>
possibly be a physical or dynamical, though there may well be
a math­e­mat­i­cal <i>Law of Growth</i>, which is common to, and which
defines, the spiral form in the Nautilus, in the Globigerina, in the
ram’s horn, and in the disc of the sunflower.</p>

<p>Of the spiral forms which we have now mentioned, every one
(with the single exception of the outline of the cordate leaf) is an
example of the remarkable curve known as the Logarithmic Spiral.
But before we enter upon the mathematics of the logarithmic
spiral, let us carefully observe that the whole of the organic forms
in which it is clearly and permanently exhibited, however different
they may be from one another in outward appearance, in nature
and in origin, nevertheless all belong, in a certain sense, to one
particular class of conformations. In the great majority of cases,
when we consider an organism in part or whole, when we look (for
instance) at our own hand or foot, or contemplate an insect or
a worm, we have no reason (or very little) to consider one part
of the existing structure as <i>older</i> than another; through and
through, the newer particles have been merged and commingled,
by intussusception, among the old; the whole outline, such as it
is, is due to forces which for the most part are still at work to
shape it, and which in shaping it have shaped it as a whole. But
the horn, or the snail-shell, is curiously different; for in each of
these, the presently existing structure is, so to speak, partly old
and partly new; it has been conformed by successive and continuous
increments; and each successive stage of growth, starting
from the origin, remains as an integral and unchanging portion
of the still growing structure, and so continues to represent what
at some earlier epoch constituted for the time being the structure
in its entirety.</p>

<p>In a slightly different, but closely cognate way, the same is
true of the spirally arranged florets of the sunflower. For here
again we are regarding serially arranged portions of a composite
structure, which portions, similar to one another in form, <i>differ
in age</i>; and they differ also in magnitude in a strict ratio according
to their age. Somehow or other, in the logarithmic spiral the
<i>time-element</i> always enters in; and to this important fact, full of
curious biological as well as math­e­mat­i­cal significance, we shall
afterwards return. <span class="xxpn" id="p497">{497}</span></p>

<p>It is, as we have so often seen, an essential part of our whole
problem, to try to understand what distribution of forces is capable
of producing this or that organic form,—to give, in short, a
dynamical expression to our descriptive morphology. Now the
<i>general</i> distribution of forces which lead to the formation of a
spiral (whether logarithmic or other) is very easily understood;
and need not carry us beyond the use of very elementary mathematics.</p>

<div class="dctr04" id="fig239">
<img src="images/i497.png" width="532" height="512" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 239.</div></div>

<p>If we imagine growth to act in a perpendicular direction, as for
example the upward force of growth in a growing stem (<i>OA</i>), then,
in the absence of other forces, elongation will as a matter of course
proceed in an unchanging direction, that is to say the stem will
grow straight upwards. Suppose now that there be some constant
<i>external force</i>, such as the wind, impinging on the growing stem;
and suppose (for simplicity’s sake) that this external force be in a
constant direction (<i>AB</i>) perpendicular to the intrinsic force of growth.
The direction of actual growth will be in the line of the resultant
of the two forces: and, since the external force is (by hypothesis)
constant in direction, while the internal force tends always to act in
the line of actual growth, it is obvious that our growing organism
will tend to be bent into a curve, to which, for
the time being, <span class="xxpn" id="p498">{498}</span>
the actual force of growth will be acting at a tangent. So long
as the two forces continue to act, the curve will approach, but
will never attain, the direction of <i>AB</i>, perpendicular to the original
direction <i>OA</i>. If the external force be constant in amount the
curve will ap­prox­i­mate to the form of a hyperbola; and, at any
rate, it is obvious that it will never tend to assume a spiral
form.</p>

<p>In like manner, if we consider a horizontal beam, fixed at one
end, the imposition of a weight at the other will bend the beam
into a curve, which, as the beam elongates or the weight increases,
will bring the weighted end nearer and nearer to the vertical.
But such a force, constant in direction, will obviously never curve
the beam into a spiral,—a fact so patent and obvious that it would
be superfluous to state it, were it not that some naturalists have
been in the habit of invoking gravity as the force to which may be
attributed the spiral flexure of the shell.</p>

<p>But if, on the other hand, the deflecting force be <i>inherent</i> in
the growing body, or so connected with it in a system that its
direction (instead of being constant, as in the former case) changes
with the direction of growth, and is perpendicular (or inclined at
some constant angle) to this changing direction of the growing
force, then it is plain that there is no such limit to the deflection
from the normal, but the growing curve will tend to wind round
and round its point of origin. In the typical case of the snail-shell,
such an intrinsic force is manifestly present in the action
of the columellar muscle.</p>

<p>Many other simple illustrations can be given of a spiral course
being impressed upon what is primarily rectilinear motion, by
any steady deflecting force which the moving body carries, so
to speak, along with it, and which continually gives a lop-sided
tendency to its forward movement. For instance, we have been told
that a man or a horse, travelling over a great prairie, is very apt
to find himself, after a long day’s journey, back again near to his
starting point. Here some small and imperceptible bias, such as
might for instance be caused by one leg being in a minute degree
longer or stronger than the other, has steadily deflected the forward
movement to one side; and has gradually brought the traveller
back, perhaps in a circle to the very point from which
he set out, <span class="xxpn" id="p499">{499}</span>
or else by a spiral curve, somewhere within reach and recognition
of it.</p>

<p>We come to a similar result when we consider, for instance,
a cylindrical body in which forces of growth are at work tending
to its elongation, but these forces are unsymmetrically distributed.
Let the tendency to elongation along <i>AB</i> be of a magnitude proportional
to <i>BB&#xfeff;′</i>, and that along <i>CD</i> be of a magnitude proportional
to <i>DD&#xfeff;′</i>; and in each element parallel to <i>AB</i> and <i>CD</i>, let a parallel
force of growth, proportionately intermediate in magnitude, be at
work: and let <i>EFF&#xfeff;′</i> be the middle line. Then at any cross-section
<i>BFD</i>, if we deduct the mean force <i>FF&#xfeff;′</i>, we have a certain
positive force at <i>B</i>, equal to <i>Bb</i>, and an equal and opposite force
at <i>D</i>, equal to <i>Dd</i>. But <i>AB</i> and <i>CD</i> are not separate</p>

<div class="dctr04" id="fig240">

<p class="pcontinue">structures,
but are connected together, either by a solid core, or by the walls
of a tubular shell; and the forces which tend to separate <i>B</i> and
<i>D</i> are opposed, accordingly, by a <i>tension</i> in <i>BD</i>. It follows therefore,
that there will be a resultant force <i>BG</i>, acting in a direction
intermediate between <i>Bb</i> and <i>BD</i>, and also a resultant, <i>DH</i>,
acting at <i>D</i> in an opposite direction; and accordingly, after a
small increment of growth, the growing end of the cylinder will
come to lie, not in the direction <i>BD</i>, but in the direction <i>GH</i>.
The problem is therefore analogous to that of a beam to which
we apply a bending moment; and it is plain that the unequal
force of growth is equivalent to a “<i>couple</i>” which will impart to
our structure a curved form. For, if we regard the part <i>ABDC</i>
as practically rigid, and the part <i>BB&#xfeff;′D&#xfeff;′D</i> as
pliable, this couple <span class="xxpn" id="p500">{500}</span>
will tend to turn strips such as <i>B&#xfeff;′D&#xfeff;′</i> about an axis perpendicular
to the plane of the diagram, and passing through an intermediate
point <i>F&#xfeff;′</i>. It is plain, also, since all the forces under consideration
are <i>intrinsic to the system</i>, that this tendency will be continuous,
and that as growth proceeds the curving body will assume either
a circular or a spiral form. But the tension which we have here
assumed to exist in the direction <i>BD</i> will obviously disappear if
we suppose a sufficiently rapid rate of growth in that direction.
For if we may regard the mouth of our tubular shell as <i>perfectly
extensible</i> in its own plane, so that it exerts no traction whatsoever
on the sides, then it will be drawn out into more and more elongated
ellipses, forming the more and more oblique orifices of a <i>straight</i>
tube. In other words, in such a structure as we have presupposed,
the existence or</p>

<div class="dctr05" id="fig241">
<img src="images/i500.png" width="449" height="287" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 241.</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">
maintenance of a constant ratio between the
rates of extension or growth in the vertical and transverse directions
will lead, in general, to the development of a logarithmic spiral;
the magnitude of that ratio will determine the character (that is
to say, the constant angle) of the spiral; and the spirals so produced
will include, as special or limiting cases, the circle and the
straight line.</p>

<p>We may dispense with the hypothesis of bending moments,
if we simply presuppose that the increments of growth take
place at a constant angle to the growing surface (as
<i>AB</i>), but more rapidly at <i>A</i> (which we shall call the
“outer edge”) than at <i>B</i>, and that this difference of
velocity maintains a constant ratio. Let us also assume
that the whole structure is rigid, the new accretions
solidifying as soon as they are laid on. For example, <span
class="xxpn" id="p501">{501}</span> let Fig. <a href="#fig242" title="go to Fig. 242">242</a> represent
in section the early growth of a Nautilus-shell, and let
the part <i>ARB</i> represent the earliest stage of all, which
in Nautilus is nearly semicircular. We have to find a law
governing the growth of the shell, such that each edge
shall develop into an equiangular spiral; and this law,
accordingly, must be the same for each edge, namely that at
each instant the direction of growth makes a constant angle
with a line drawn from a fixed point (called the pole of
the spiral) to the point at which growth is taking place.
This growth, we now find, may be considered as effected by
the continuous addition of similar quadrilaterals. Thus,
in Fig. <a href="#fig241" title="go to Fig. 241">241</a>, <i>AEDB</i> is a quadrilateral with <i>AE</i>, <i>DB</i>
parallel, and with the angle <i>EAB</i> of a certain definite</p>

<p class="pcontinue">magnitude,
=&#x202f;γ. Let <i>AB</i> and <i>ED</i> meet, when produced, in <i>C</i>;
and call the angle <i>ACE</i> (or <i>xCy</i>)
=&#x202f;β. Make the angle <i>yCz</i>
=&#x202f;angle
<i>xCy</i>,
=&#x202f;β. Draw <i>EG</i>, so that the angle <i>yEG</i>
=&#x202f;γ, meeting <i>Cz</i> in
<i>G</i>; and draw <i>DF</i> parallel to <i>EG</i>. It is then easy to show that
<i>AEDB</i> and <i>EGFD</i> are similar quadrilaterals. And, when we
consider the quadrilateral <i>AEDB</i> as having infinitesimal sides,
<i>AE</i> and <i>BD</i>, the angle γ tends to α, the constant angle of an equiangular
spiral which passes through the points <i>AEG</i>, and of a
similar spiral which passes through the points <i>BDF</i>; and the point
<i>C</i> is the pole of both of these spirals. In a particular limiting case,
when our quadrilaterals are all equal as well as similar,—which
will be the case when the angle γ (or the angles <i>EAC</i>,
etc.) is a <span class="xxpn" id="p502">{502}</span>
right angle,—the “spiral” curve will be a circular arc, <i>C</i> being the
centre of the circle.</p>

<p>Another, and a very simple illustration may be drawn from the
“cymose inflorescences” of the botanists, though the actual
mode of development of some of these structures is open to
dispute, and their nomenclature is involved in extraordinary
historical confusion<a class="afnanch" href="#fn496"

 cyme.</div></div>

<p>In Fig. <a href="#fig243" title="go to Fig. 243">243</a><i>B</i> (which represents the <i>Cicinnus</i> of Schimper, or
<i>cyme unipare scorpioide</i> of Bravais, as seen in the Borage),
we begin with a primary shoot from which is given off, at a
certain definite angle, a secondary shoot: and from that in
turn, on the same side and at the same angle, another shoot,
and so on. The deflection, or curvature, is continuous and
progressive, for it is caused by no external force but only
by causes intrinsic in the system. And the whole system is
symmetrical: the angles at which the successive shoots are
given off being all equal, and the lengths of the shoots
diminishing <i>in constant ratio</i>. The result is that the
successive shoots, or successive increments of growth, are
tangents to a curve, and this curve is a true logarithmic
spiral. But while, in this simple case, the successive shoots
are depicted as lying <i>in a plane</i>, it may also happen that,
in addition to their successive angular divergence from one
another within that plane, they also tend to diverge by
successive equal angles <i>from</i> that plane of reference; and
by this means, there will be superposed upon the logarithmic
spiral a helicoid twist or screw. And, in the particular case
where this latter angle of divergence is just equal to 180°,
or two right angles, the successive shoots will once more
come to lie in a plane, but they will appear to come off from
one another on <i>alternate</i> sides, as in Fig. <a href="#fig243" title="go to Fig. 243">243</a>&#x202f;<i>A</i>.
This is the <i>Schraubel</i> or <i>Bostryx</i> of Schimper, the <i>cyme
unipare hélicoide</i> of Bravais. The logarithmic spiral is still
latent in it, as in the other; but is concealed from view by
the deformation resulting from the helicoid. The confusion of
nomenclature would seem to have arisen from the fact that many
botanists did not recognise (as the brothers Bravais did) the
math­e­mat­i­cal significance of the latter case; but were led, by
the snail-like spiral of the scorpioid cyme, to transfer the
name “helicoid” to it. <br class="brclrfix" /></p>
</div><!--psmprnt3-->

<p>In the study of such curves as these, then, we speak of the
point of origin as the pole (<i>O</i>); a straight line having its extremity
in the pole and revolving about it, is called
the radius vector; <span class="xxpn" id="p503">{503}</span>
and a point (<i>P</i>) which is conceived as travelling along the radius
vector under definite conditions of velocity, will then describe our
spiral curve.</p>

<p>Of several math­e­mat­i­cal curves whose form and development
may be so conceived, the two most important (and the only two
with which we need deal), are those which are known as (1) the
equable spiral, or spiral of Archimedes, and (2) the logarithmic,
or equiangular spiral.</p>

<div class="dctr05" id="fig244">
<img src="images/i503.png" width="449" height="421" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 244.</div></div>

<p>The former may be illustrated by the spiral coil in which a
sailor coils a rope upon the deck; as the rope is of uniform thickness,
so in the whole spiral coil is each whorl of the same breadth
as that which precedes and as that which follows it. Using
its ancient definition, we may define it by saying, that “If a
straight line revolve uniformly about its extremity, a point which
likewise travels uniformly along it will describe the equable
spiral<a class="afnanch" href="#fn497" id="fnanch497">497</a>.”
Or, putting the same thing into our more modern
words, “If, while the radius vector revolve uniformly about the
pole, a point (<i>P</i>) travel with uniform velocity along it, the curve
described will be that called the equable spiral, or spiral of
Archimedes.” <span class="xxpn" id="p504">{504}</span>
<br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<p>It is plain that the spiral of Archimedes may be compared to
a <i>cylinder</i> coiled up. And it is plain also that a radius (<i>r</i>
=&#x202f;<i>OP</i>),
made up of the successive and equal whorls, will increase in
<i>arithmetical</i> progression: and will equal a certain constant
quantity (<i>a</i>) multiplied by the whole number of whorls, or (more
strictly speaking) multiplied by the whole angle (θ) through
which it has revolved: so that <i>r</i>
=&#x202f;<i>a</i>θ.</p>

<p>But, in contrast to this, in the logarithmic spiral of the Nautilus
or the snail-shell, the whorls gradually increase in breadth,
and do so in a steady and unchanging ratio. Our definition is
as follows: “If, instead of travelling with a <i>uniform</i> velocity,
our point move along the radius vector with <i>a velocity increasing
as its distance from the pole</i>, then the path described is called a
logarithmic spiral.” Each whorl which the radius vector intersects
will be broader than its predecessor in a definite ratio; the
radius vector will increase in length in <i>geometrical</i> progression,
as it sweeps through successive equal angles; and the equation
to the spiral will be <i>r</i>
=&#x202f;<i>a</i>&#xfeff;<sup>θ</sup>&#x202f;. As the spiral of Archimedes, in our
example of the coiled rope, might be looked upon as a coiled
cylinder, so may the logarithmic spiral, in the case of the shell,
be pictured as a <i>cone</i> coiled upon itself.</p>

<p>Now it is obvious that if the whorls increase very slowly indeed,
the logarithmic spiral will come to look like a spiral of Archimedes,
with which however it never becomes identical; for it is incorrect
to say, as is sometimes done, that the Archimedean spiral is a
“limiting case” of the logarithmic spiral. The Nummulite is a
case in point. Here we have a large number of whorls, very
narrow, very close together, and apparently of equal breadth,
which give rise to an appearance similar to that of our coiled
rope. And, in a case of this kind, we might actually find that
the whorls <i>were</i> of equal breadth, being produced (as is apparently
the case in the Nummulite) not by any very slow and gradual
growth in thickness of a continuous tube, but by a succession of
similar cells or chambers laid on, round and round, determined as
to their size by constant surface-tension conditions and therefore
of unvarying dimensions. But even in this case we should
have no Archimedean spiral, but only a logarithmic spiral in
which the constant angle
approximated to 90°. <span class="xxpn" id="p505">{505}</span></p>

<div class="psmprnt3">
<p>For, in the logarithmic spiral, when α tends to 90°,
the expression <i>r</i>
=&#x202f;<i>a</i>&#xfeff;<sup>θ&#x202f;cot&#x202f;α</sup>
tends to <i>r</i>
=&#x202f;<i>a</i>(1&#x202f;+&#x202f;θ&#x202f;cot&#x202f;α);
while the equation to the Archimedean spiral is
<i>r</i>
=&#x202f;<i>b</i>θ. The nummulite must always have a central core, or initial cell,
around which the coil is not only wrapped, <i>but out of which it springs</i>; and

<i>r</i>
=&#x202f;<i>a&#xfeff;′</i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;<i>a</i>θ&#x202f;cot&#x202f;α. The
outer whorls resemble those of an Archimedean spiral, because
of the other term <i>a</i>θ&#x202f;cot&#x202f;α in the same
expression. It follows from this that in all such cases the
whorls must be of excessively small breadth.</p>

<p>There are many other specific properties of the logarithmic
spiral, so interrelated to one another that we may choose pretty
well any one of them as the basis of our definition, and deduce the
others from it either by analytical methods or by the methods of
elementary geometry. For instance, the equation <i>r</i>
=&#x202f;<i>a</i>&#xfeff;<sup>θ</sup> may be
written in the form log&#x202f;<i>r</i>
=&#x202f;θ&#x202f;log&#x202f;<i>a</i>, or θ
=&#x202f;(log&#x202f;<i>r</i>)&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;(log&#x202f;<i>a</i>),
or (since <i>a</i> is
a constant), θ
=&#x202f;<i>k</i>&#x202f;log&#x202f;<i>r</i>. Which is as much as to say that the
vector angles about the pole are proportional to the logarithms
of the successive radii; from which circumstance the name of the
“logarithmic spiral” is derived.</p>

<p>Let us next regard our logarithmic spiral from the
dynamical point of view, as when we consider the forces
concerned in the growth of a material, concrete spiral.
In a growing structure, let the forces of growth exerted
at any point <i>P</i> be a force <i>F</i> acting along the line
joining <i>P</i> to a pole <i>O</i> and a force <i>T</i> acting in a
direction perpendicular to <i>OP</i>; and let the magnitude
of these forces be in the same constant ratio at all
points. It follows that the resultant of the forces <i>F</i>
and <i>T</i> (as <i>PQ</i>) makes a constant angle with the radius
vector. But the constancy of the angle between tangent
and radius vector at any point is a fundamental property
of the logarithmic spiral, and may be shewn to follow
from our definition of the curve: it gives to the curve
its alternative name of <i>equiangular spiral</i>. Hence in
a structure growing under the above conditions the form
of the boundary will be a logarithmic spiral. <span

<div class="dmaths">
<p>In such a spiral, radial growth and growth in the direction of
the curve bear a constant ratio to one another. For, if we consider
a consecutive radius vector, <i>OP&#xfeff;′</i>, whose increment
as compared with <i>OP</i> is <i>dr</i>, while <i>ds</i> is the small

<p>In the concrete case of the shell, the distribution
of forces will be, originally, a little more complicated
than this, though by resolving the forces in question,
the system may be reduced to this simple form. And
furthermore, the actual distribution of forces will not
always be identical; for example, there is a distinct
difference between the cases (as in the snail) where
a columellar muscle exerts a definite traction in the
direction of the pole, and those (such as Nautilus)
where there is no columellar muscle, and where some other
force must be discovered, or postulated, to account for the
flexure. In the most frequent case, we have, as in Fig. <a
href="#fig247" title="go to Fig. 247">247</a>, three forces
to deal with, acting at a point, <i>p</i>&#x202f;:&#x202f;<i>L</i>,
acting<br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<p class="pcontinue">
in the direction of the tangent to the curve,
and representing the force of longitudinal growth; <i>T</i>,
perpendicular to <i>L</i>, and representing the organism’s
tendency to grow in breadth; and <i>P</i>, the traction
exercised, in the direction of the pole, by the columellar
muscle. Let us resolve <i>L</i> and <i>T</i> into components along
<i>P</i> (namely <i>A&#xfeff;′</i>, <i>B&#xfeff;′</i>), and perpendicular to <i>P</i> (namely
<i>A</i>, <i>B</i>); we have now only two forces to consider,
viz. <i>P</i>&#x202f;−&#x202f;<i>A&#xfeff;′</i>&#x202f;−&#x202f;<i>B&#xfeff;′</i>, and
<i>A</i>&#x202f;−&#x202f;<i>B</i>. And these two latter we can
again resolve, if we please, so as to deal only with
forces in the direction of <i>P</i> and <i>T</i>. Now, the ratio
of these forces remaining constant, the locus of the
point <i>p</i> is an equiangular spiral. <span class="xxpn"
id="p507">{507}</span></p>

<p>Furthermore we see how any <i>slight</i> change in any one of the
forces <i>P</i>, <i>T</i>, <i>L</i> will tend to modify the angle α, and produce a slight
departure from the absolute regularity of the logarithmic spiral.
Such slight departures from the absolute simplicity and uniformity
of the theoretic law we shall not be surprised to find, more or less
frequently, in Nature, in the complex system of forces presented
by the living organism. <br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<p>In the growth of a shell, we can conceive no simpler law than
this, namely, that it shall widen and lengthen in the same unvarying
proportions: and this simplest of laws is that which Nature tends
to follow. The shell, like the creature within it, grows in size
<i>but does not change its shape</i>; and the existence of this constant
relativity of growth, or constant similarity of form, is of the essence,
and may be made the basis of a definition, of the logarithmic
spiral.</p>

<p>Such a definition, though not commonly used by mathematicians,
has been occasionally employed; and it is one from
which the other properties of the curve can be deduced with
great ease and simplicity. In math­e­mat­i­cal language it would run
as follows: “Any [plane] curve proceeding from a fixed point
(which is called the pole), and such that the arc intercepted between
this point and any other whatsoever on the curve is always similar
to itself, is called an equiangular, or logarithmic, spiral<a class="afnanch" href="#fn498" id="fnanch498">498</a>.”</p>

<p>In this definition, we have what is probably the most fundamental
and “intrinsic” property of the curve, namely the property
of continual similarity: and this is indeed the very property by
reason of which it is peculiarly associated with organic growth in
such structures as the horn or the shell, or the scorpioid cyme
which is described on p. <a href="#p502" title="go to pg. 502">502</a>. For it is peculiarly char­ac­ter­is­tic
of the spiral of a shell, for instance, that (under all normal circumstances)
it does not alter its shape as it grows; each increment is
geometrically similar to its predecessor, and the whole, at any
epoch, is similar to what constituted the whole at another and an
earlier epoch. We feel no surprise when the animal which secretes
the shell, or any other animal whatsoever,
grows by such <span class="xxpn" id="p508">{508}</span>
<i>symmetrical</i> expansion as to preserve its form unchanged; though
even there, as we have already seen, the unchanging form denotes
a nice balance between the rates of growth in various directions,
which is but seldom accurately maintained for long. But the
shell retains its unchanging form in spite of its <i>asymmetrical</i>
growth; it grows at one end only, and so does the horn. And
this remarkable property of increasing by <i>terminal</i> growth, but
nevertheless retaining unchanged the form of the entire figure, is
char­ac­ter­is­tic of the logarithmic spiral, and of no other math­e­mat­i­cal
curve.</p>

<div class="dctr05" id="fig248">
<img src="images/i508.png" width="448" height="220" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 248.</div></div>

<p>We may at once illustrate this curious phenomenon by drawing
the outline of a little Nautilus shell within a big one. We know,
or we may see at once, that they are of precisely the same shape;
so that, if we look at the little shell through a magnifying glass,
it becomes identical with the big one. But we know, on the other
hand, that the little Nautilus shell grows into the big one, not by
uniform growth or magnification in all directions, as is (though
only ap­prox­i­mate­ly) the case when the boy grows into the man,
but by growing <i>at one end only</i>.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Though of all curves, this property of continued similarity is
found only in the logarithmic spiral, there are very many rectilinear
figures in which it may be observed. For instance, as we may
easily see, it holds good of any right cone; for evidently, in Fig. <a href="#fig248" title="go to Fig. 248">248</a>,
the little inner cone (represented in its triangular section) may
become identical with the larger one either by magnification all
round (as in <i>a</i>), or simply by an increment at one end (as in <i>b</i>);
indeed, in the case of the cone, we have yet a third possibility,
for the same result is attained when it increases all round, save
only at the base, that is to say when the
triangular section increases <span class="xxpn" id="p509">{509}</span>
on two of its sides, as in <i>c</i>. All this is closely associated with the
fact, which we have already noted, that the Nautilus shell is but
a cone rolled up; in other words, the cone is but a particular
variety, or “limiting case,” of the spiral shell.</p>

<p>This property, which we so easily recognise in the cone, would
seem to have engaged the particular attention of the most ancient
mathematicians even from the days of Pythagoras, and so, with
little doubt, from the more ancient days of that Egyptian school
whence he derived the foundations of his learning<a class="afnanch" href="#fn499" id="fnanch499">499</a>;
and its bearing
on our biological problem of the shell, though apparently indirect,
is yet so close that it deserves our further consideration.</p>

<p>In any triangle, as Aristotle tells us, one part is always a
gnomon to the other part. For instance, in the triangle <i>ABC</i>
(Fig. <a href="#fig253" title="go to Fig. 253">253</a>), let us draw <i>CD</i>, so as to make the angle <i>BCD</i> equal to
the angle <i>A</i>. Then the part <i>BCD</i> is a triangle similar to the
whole triangle <i>ABC</i>, and <i>ADC</i> is a gnomon to <i>BCD</i>. A very
elegant case is when the original triangle <i>ABC</i> is an isosceles
triangle having one angle of 36°, and the other two angles, therefore,
each equal to 72° (Fig. <a href="#fig254" title="go to Fig. 254">254</a>). Then, by bisecting one of the
angles of the base, we subdivide the large isosceles triangle into
two isosceles triangles, of which one is similar to the whole figure
and the other is its gnomon<a class="afnanch" href="#fn502" id="fnanch502">502</a>.
There is good reason to believe
that this triangle was especially studied by the Pythagoreans;
for it lies at the root of many interesting geometrical constructions,
such as the regular pentagon, and the mystical “pentalpha,” and
a whole range of other curious figures beloved of the ancient
mathematicians<a class="afnanch" href="#fn503" id="fnanch503">503</a>.

<p>If we take any one of these figures, for instance the isosceles
triangle which we have just described,
and add to it (or subtract from it) in
succession a series of gnomons, so converting
it into larger and larger (or smaller
and smaller) triangles all similar to the
first, we find that the apices (or other
cor­re­spon­ding points) of all these triangles
have their <i>locus</i> upon a logarithmic spiral:
a result which follows directly from that
alternative definition of the logarithmic
spiral which I have quoted from Whitworth
(p. <a href="#p507" title="go to pg. 507">507</a>).</p>

<p>Again, we may build up a series of
right-angled triangles, each of which is a
gnomon to the preceding figure; and here again, a logarithmic
spiral is the locus of cor­re­spon­ding points in these successive
triangles. And lastly, whensoever we fill up

<p>Once more, then, we may modify our definition, and say that:
“Any plane curve proceeding from a fixed point (or pole), and such
that the vectorial area of any sector is always a gnomon to the

other related organic forms, by saying that: (1) if a growing</p>

all other organic forms in which a logarithmic spiral can be
recognised, that <i>each successive increment of growth is a gnomon

obviously, that in the logarithmic spiral outline of the shell

<p>Of these three propositions, the second is of very great use

an elephant’s tusk, or each new
chamber of a spiral foraminifer
(Figs. <a href="#fig259" title="go to Fig. 259">259</a> and 260), has its leading
char­ac­ter­is­tic at once described and
its form so far explained by the
simple statement that it constitutes
a <i>gnomon</i> to the whole previously
existing structure. And herein lies
the explanation of that “time-element”
in the development of
organic spirals of which we have
spoken already, in a preliminary
and empirical way. For it follows
as a simple corollary to this
theorem of gnomons that we must not expect to find the
logarithmic spiral manifested in a structure whose parts are
simultaneously produced, as for instance in the margin of a
leaf, or among the many curves that make the contour of a
fish. But we must rather look for it wherever the organism
retains for us, and still presents to us at a single view, the successive
phases of preceding growth, the successive magnitudes attained,
the successive outlines occupied, as the organism or a part thereof
pursued the even tenour of its growth, year by year and day by
day. And it easily follows from this, that it is in the hard parts
of organisms, and not the soft, fleshy, actively growing parts,
that this spiral is commonly and char­ac­teris­ti­cally found; not
in the fresh mobile tissues whose form is constrained merely by
the active forces of the moment; but in things like shell and tusk,
and horn and claw, where the object is visibly
composed of parts <span class="xxpn" id="p516">{516}</span>
successively, and permanently, laid down. In the main, the
logarithmic spiral is char­ac­ter­is­tic, not of the living tissues, but
of the dead. And for the same reason, it will always or nearly
always be accompanied, and adorned, by a pattern formed of
“lines of growth,” the lasting record of earlier and successive
stages of form and magnitude. <br class="brclrfix" />
</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>It is evident that the spiral curve of the shell is, in a sense,
a vector diagram of its own growth; for it shews at each instant
of time, the direction, radial and tangential, of growth, and the
unchanging ratio of velocities in these directions. Regarding the
<i>actual</i> velocity of growth in the shell, we know very little (or
practically nothing), by way of experimental measurement; but
if we make a certain simple assumption, then we may go a good
deal further in our description of the logarithmic spiral as it appears
in this concrete case.</p>

<p>Let us make the assumption that <i>similar</i> increments are added
to the shell in <i>equal</i> times; that is to say, that the amount of
growth in unit time is measured by the areas subtended by equal
angles. Thus, in the outer whorl of a spiral shell a definite area
marked out by ridges, tubercles, etc., has very different linear
dimensions to the cor­re­spon­ding areas of the inner whorl, but the
symmetry of the figure implies that it subtends an equal angle
with these; and it is reasonable to suppose that the successive
regions, marked out in this way by successive natural boundaries
or patterns, are produced in equal intervals of time.</p>

<p>If this be so, the radii measured from the pole to the boundary
of the shell will in each case be proportional to the velocity of
growth at this point upon the circumference, and at the time when
it corresponded with the outer lip, or region of active growth;
and while the direction of the radius vector corresponds with the
direction of growth in thickness of the animal, so does the tangent
to the curve correspond with the direction, for the time being, of
the animal’s growth in length. The successive radii are a measure
of the acceleration of growth, and the spiral curve of the shell
itself is no other than the <i>hodograph</i> of the growth of the contained
organism. <span class="xxpn" id="p517">{517}</span></p>

<p>So far as we have now gone, we have studied the elementary
properties of the logarithmic spiral, including its fundamental
property of <i>continued similarity</i>; and we have accordingly learned
that the shell or the horn tends <i>necessarily</i> to assume the form
of this math­e­mat­i­cal figure, because in these structures growth
proceeds by successive increments, which are always similar in
form, similarly situated, and of constant relative magnitude one
to another. Our chief objects in enquiring further into the
math­e­mat­i­cal properties of the logarithmic spiral will be: (1) to
find means of confirming and verifying the fact that the shell (or
other organic curve) is actually a logarithmic spiral; (2) to learn
how, by the properties of the curve, we may further extend our
knowledge or simplify our descriptions of the shell; and (3) to
understand the factors by which the char­ac­ter­is­tic form of any
particular logarithmic spiral is determined, and so to comprehend
the nature of the specific or generic characters by which one spiral
shell is found to differ from another.</p>

<p>Of the elementary properties of the logarithmic spiral, so far as
we have now enumerated them, the following are those which we
may most easily in­ves­ti­gate in the concrete case, such as we have
to do with in the molluscan shell: (1) that the polar radii of points
whose vectorial angles are in arithmetical progression, are themselves
in geometrical progression; and (2) that the tangent at any
point of a logarithmic spiral makes a constant
angle (called the <i>angle of the spiral</i>) with the
polar radius vector.</p>

<div class="dright dwth-h" id="fig261">
<img src="images/i517.png" width="208" height="415" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 261.</div></div>

<p>The former of these two propositions may be written
in what is, perhaps, a simpler form, as follows:
radii which form equal angles about the pole of
the logarithmic spiral, are themselves continued
proportionals. That is to say, in Fig. <a href="#fig261" title="go to Fig. 261">261</a>, when
the angle <i>ROQ</i> is equal to the angle <i>QOP</i>, then
<i>OR</i>&#x202f;:&#x202f;<i>OQ</i>&#x202f;::&#x202f;<i>OQ</i>&#x202f;:&#x202f;<i>OP</i>.</p>

<p>A particular case of this proposition is when the equal
angles are each angles of 360°: that is to say when in
each case the radius vector makes a complete revolution,
and when, therefore <i>P</i>, <i>Q</i> and <i>R</i> all lie upon the same
radius. <span class="xxpn" id="p518">{518}</span></p>

<p>It was by observing, with the help of very careful
measurement, this continued proportionality, that Moseley
was enabled to verify his first assumption, based on
the general appearance of the shell, that the shell of
Nautilus was actually a logarithmic spiral, and this
demonstration he was immediately afterwards in a position
to generalise by extending it to all the spiral Ammonitoid
and Gastropod mollusca<a class="afnanch" href="#fn505"
id="fnanch505">505</a>. <br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<p>For, taking a median transverse section of a <i>Nautilus pompilius</i>,
and carefully measuring the successive breadths of the whorls
(from the dark line which marks what was originally the outer
surface, before it was covered up by fresh deposits on the part
of the growing and advancing shell), Moseley found that “the
distance of any two of its whorls measured upon a radius vector
is one-third that of the two next whorls measured upon the same
radius vector<a class="afnanch" href="#fn506" id="fnanch506">506</a>.
Thus (in Fig. <a href="#fig262" title="go to Fig. 262">262</a>), <i>ab</i> is one-third of <i>bc</i>, <i>de</i> of
<i>ef</i>, <i>gh</i> of <i>hi</i>, and <i>kl</i> of <i>lm</i>. The curve is therefore a logarithmic
spiral.”</p>

<p>The numerical ratio in the case of the Nautilus happens to
be one of unusual simplicity. Let us take, with Moseley, a
somewhat more complicated example.</p>

<p>From the apex of a large specimen of <i>Turbo duplicatus</i><a class="afnanch" href="#fn507" id="fnanch507">507</a>
a <span class="xxpn" id="p519">{519}</span>
line was drawn across its whorls, and their widths were measured
upon it in succession, beginning with the last but one. The
measurements were, as before, made with a fine pair of compasses
and a diagonal scale. The sight was assisted by a magnifying
glass. In a parallel column to the following admeasurements
are the terms of a geometric progression, whose first term is the
width of the widest whorl measured, and whose common ratio is
1·1804.</p>

<p>The close coincidence between the observed and the calculated
figures is very remarkable, and is amply sufficient to justify the
conclusion that we are here dealing with a true logarithmic
spiral.</p>

<div class="dmaths">
<p>Nevertheless, in order to verify his conclusion still further,
and to get partially rid of the inaccuracies due
to successive small <span class="xxpn" id="p520">{520}</span>
measurements, Moseley proceeded to in­ves­ti­gate the same shell,
measuring not single whorls, but groups of whorls, taken several
at a time: making use of the following property of a geometrical
progression, that “if µ represent the ratio of the sum of every
even number (<i>m</i>) of its terms to the sum of half that number of
terms, then the common ratio (<i>r</i>) of the series is represented by
the formula</p>

</div></div><!--dmaths-->

<p>Accordingly, Moseley made the following measurements,
beginning from the second and third whorls respectively:</p>

<p>The logarithmic spiral is not only very beautifully manifested
in the molluscan shell, but also, in certain cases, in the little lid
or “operculum” by which the entrance to the tubular shell is
closed after the animal has withdrawn itself within. In the spiral
shell of <i>Turbo</i>, for instance, the operculum is a thick calcareous
structure, with a beautifully curved outline, which grows by
successive increments applied to one portion of its edge, and shews,
accordingly, a spiral line of growth upon its surface. The successive
increments leave their traces on the surface
of the operculum <span class="xxpn" id="p522">{522}</span>
(Fig. <a href="#fig264" title="go to Fig. 264">264</a>, 1), which traces have the form of curved lines in
Turbo, and of straight lines in (e.g.) Nerita (Fig. <a href="#fig264" title="go to Fig. 264">264</a>, 2); that
is to say, apart from the side constituting the outer edge of the
operculum (which side is always and of necessity curved) the
successive increments constitute curvilinear triangles in the one
case, and rectilinear triangles in the other. The sides of these
triangles are tangents to the spiral line of the operculum, and
may be supposed to generate it by their consecutive intersections.</p>

<div><span class="xxpn" id="p523">{523}</span></div>

<p>The ratio is ap­prox­i­mate­ly constant, and this spiral also is,
therefore, a logarithmic spiral.</p>

<p>But here comes in a very beautiful illustration of that property
of the logarithmic spiral which causes its whole shape to remain
unchanged, in spite of its apparently unsymmetrical, or unilateral,
mode of growth. For the mouth of the tubular shell, into which
the operculum has to fit, is growing or widening on all sides:
while the operculum is increasing, not by additions made at the
same time all round its margin, but by additions made only on
one side of it at each successive stage. One edge of the operculum
thus remains unaltered as it is advanced into each new position,
and as it is placed in a newly formed section of the tube, similar
to but greater than the last. Nevertheless, the two apposed
structures, the chamber and its plug, at all times fit one another
to perfection. The mechanical problem (by no means an easy
one), is thus solved: “How to shape a tube of a variable section,
so that a piston driven along it shall, by one side of its margin,
coincide continually with its surface as it advances, provided only
that the piston be made at the same time continually to revolve
in its own plane.”</p>

<p>As Moseley puts it: “That the same edge which fitted a portion
of the first less section should be capable of adjustment, so as to
fit a portion of the next similar but greater section, supposes
a geometrical provision in the curved form of the chamber of
great apparent complication and difficulty. But God hath
bestowed upon this humble architect the practical skill of a
learned geometrician, and he makes this provision with admirable
precision in that curvature of the logarithmic spiral which he
gives to the section of the shell. This curvature obtaining, he
has only to turn his operculum slightly round in its own plane as
he advances it into each newly formed portion of his chamber,
to adapt one margin of it to a new and larger surface and a different
curvature, leaving the space to be filled up by increasing the
operculum wholly on the other margin.”</p>

<p>But in many, and indeed more numerous Gastropod mollusca,
the operculum does not grow in this remarkable spiral fashion,
but by the apparently much simpler process of accretion by
concentric rings. This suggests to
us another math­e­mat­i­cal <span class="xxpn" id="p524">{524}</span>
feature of the logarithmic spiral. We have already seen that the
logarithmic spiral has a number of “limiting cases,” apparently
very diverse from one another. Thus the right cone is a logarithmic
spiral in which the revolution of the radius vector is infinitely
slow; and, in the same sense, the straight line itself is a limiting
case of the logarithmic spiral. The spiral of Archimedes, though
not a limiting case of the logarithmic spiral, closely resembles
one in which the angle of the spiral is very near to 90°, and the
spiral is coiled around a central core. But if the angle of the
spiral were actually 90°, the radius vector would describe a circle,
identical with the “core” of which we have just spoken; and
accordingly it may be said that the circle is, in this sense, a true
limiting case of the logarithmic spiral. In this sense, then, the
circular concentric operculum, for instance of Turritella or
Littorina, does not represent a breach of continuity, but a “limiting
case” of the spiral operculum of <i>Turbo</i>; the successive “gnomons”
are now not lateral or terminal additions, but complete concentric
rings.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Viewed in regard to its own fundamental properties and to
those of its limiting cases, the logarithmic spiral is the simplest
of all known curves; and the rigid uniformity of the simple laws,
or forces, by which it is developed sufficiently account for its
frequent manifestation in the structures built up by the slow and
steady growth of organisms.</p>

<p>In order to translate into precise terms the whole form and
growth of a spiral shell, we should have to employ a math­e­mat­i­cal
notation, considerably more complicated than any that I have
attempted to make use of in this book. But, in the most elementary
language, we may now at least attempt to describe the
general method, and some of the variations, of the math­e­mat­i­cal
development of the shell.</p>

<p>Let us imagine a closed curve in space, whether circular or
elliptical or of some other and more complex specific form, not
necessarily in a plane: such a curve as we see before us when we
consider the mouth, or terminal orifice, of our tubular shell; and
let us imagine some one char­ac­ter­is­tic point within this closed
curve, such as its centre of gravity. Then, starting
from a fixed <span class="xxpn" id="p525">{525}</span>
origin, let this centre of gravity describe an equiangular spiral in
space, about a fixed axis (namely the axis of the shell), while at
the same time the generating curve grows, with each angular
increment of rotation, in such a way as to preserve the symmetry
of the entire figure, with or without a simultaneous movement
of translation along the axis.</p>

<div class="dctr06" id="fig265">
<img src="images/i525.png" width="401" height="603" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 265. <i>Melo ethiopicus</i>, L.</div></div>

<p>It is plain that the entire resulting shell may now be looked
upon in either of two ways. It is, on the one hand, an <i>ensemble
of similar closed curves</i> spirally arranged in space, gradually increasing
in dimensions, in proportion to the increase of their
vectorial angle from the pole. In other words, we can imagine
our shell cut up into a system of rings, following one another in
continuous spiral succession from that terminal and largest one,
which constitutes the lip of the orifice of the shell. Or, on the
other hand, we may figure to ourselves the whole shell as made
up of an <i>ensemble of spiral lines</i> in space, each
spiral having been <span class="xxpn" id="p526">{526}</span>
traced out by the gradual growth and revolution of a radius
vector from the pole to a given point of the generating curve.</p>

<p>Both systems of lines, the <i>generating spirals</i> (as these latter
may be called), and the closed <i>generating curves</i> cor­re­spon­ding
to successive margins or lips of the shell, may be easily traced
in a great variety of cases. Thus, for example, in Dolium,
Eburnea, and a host of others, the generating spirals are beautifully
marked out</p>

<div class="dctr02" id="fig266">
<img src="images/i526.png" width="704" height="572" alt="" />
 <div class="pcaption">Fig. 266. 1, <i>Harpa</i>; 2, <i>Dolium</i>.
 The ridges on the shell correspond in (1) to generating
 curves, in (2) to generating spirals.</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">
by ridges, tubercles or bands of colour. In Trophon,
Scalaria, and (among countless others) in the Ammonites, it is
the successive generating curves which more conspicuously leave
their impress on the shell. And in not a few cases, as in
Harpa, <i>Dolium perdix</i>, etc., both alike are conspicuous, ridges
and colour-bands intersecting one another in a beautiful isogonal
system. <span class="xxpn" id="p527">{527}</span></p>

<p>In the complete math­e­mat­i­cal formula (such as I have not
ventured to set forth<a class="afnanch" href="#fn509" id="fnanch509">509</a>)
for any given turbinate shell, we should
have, accordingly, to include factors for at least the following
elements: (1) for the specific form of the section of the tube,
which we have called the generating curve; (2) for the specific
rate of growth of this generating curve; (3) for its specific rate
of angular rotation about the pole, perpendicular to the axis;
(4) in turbinate (as opposed to nautiloid) shells, for its rate of
shear, or screw-translation parallel to the axis. There are also
other factors of which we should have to take account, and which
would help to make our whole expression a very complicated one.
We should find, for instance, (5) that in very many cases our
generating curve was not a plane curve, but a sinuous curve in
three dimensions; and we should also have to take account
(6) of the inclination of the plane of this generating curve to the
axis, a factor which will have a very important influence on the
form and appearance of the shell. For instance in Haliotis it is
obvious that the generating curve lies in a plane very oblique to
the axis of the shell. Lastly, we at once perceive that the ratios
which happen to exist between these various factors, the ratio
for instance between the growth-factor and the rate of angular
revolution, will give us endless possibilities of permutation of
form. For instance (7) with a given velocity of vectorial rotation,
a certain rate of growth in the generating curve will give us a
spiral shell of which each successive whorl will just touch its
predecessor and no more; with a slower growth-factor, the whorls
will stand asunder, as in a ram’s horn; with a quicker growth-factor,
each whorl will cut or intersect its predecessor, as in an
Ammonite or the majority of gastropods, and so on (cf. p. <a href="#p541" title="go to pg. 541">541</a>).</p>

<p>In like manner (8) the ratio between the growth-factor and
the rate of screw-translation parallel to the axis will determine
the apical angle of the resulting conical structure: will give us
the difference, for example, between the sharp, pointed cone of
Turritella, the less acute one of Fusus or
Buccinum, and the <span class="xxpn" id="p528">{528}</span>
obtuse one of Harpa or Dolium. In short it is obvious that <i>all</i>
the differences of form which we observe between one shell and
another are referable to matters of <i>degree</i>, depending, one and all,
upon the relative magnitudes of the various factors in the complex
equation to the curve.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The paper in which, nearly eighty years ago, Canon Moseley
thus gave a simple math­e­mat­i­cal expression to the spiral forms of
univalve shells, is one of the classics of Natural History. But
other students before him had come very near to recognising
this math­e­mat­i­cal simplicity of form and structure. About the
year 1818, Reinecke had suggested that the relative breadths of
the adjacent whorls in an Ammonite formed a constant and
diagnostic character; and Leopold von Buch accepted and
developed the idea<a class="afnanch" href="#fn510" id="fnanch510">510</a>.
But long before, Swammerdam, with a
deeper insight, had grasped the root of the whole matter: for,
taking a few diverse examples, such as Helix and Spirula, he
shewed that they and all other spiral shells whatsoever were
referable to one common type, namely to that of a simple tube,
variously curved according to definite math­e­mat­i­cal laws; that
all manner of ornamentation, in the way of spines, tuberosities,
colour-bands and so forth, might be superposed upon them, but
the type was one throughout, and specific differences were of a
geometrical kind. “Omnis enim quae inter eas animad­verti­tur
dif­fer­en­tia ex sola nascitur di­versi­tate gyra­tionum: qui­bus si

 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 267. D’Orbigny’s
 Helicometer.</div></div>

<p>For some years after the ap­pear­ance of Mose­ley’s
paper, a number of writers followed in his foot­steps,
and at­temp­ted, in various ways, to put his con­clus­ions
to prac­tical use. For in­stance, D’Or­big­ny de­vised a
very sim­ple pro­trac­tor, which he called a Hel­i­co­meter&#xfeff;<a
class="afnanch" href="#fn512" id="fnanch512">512</a>, and
which is rep­re­sented in Fig. <a href="#fig267" title="go to Fig. 267">267</a>. By means of this lit­tle
in­stru­ment, the apical angle of the tur­bi­nate shell was
im­me­diate­ly read off, and could then be used as a spe­ci­fic
and diag­nos­tic char­acter. By keep­ing one limb of the
pro­trac­tor parallel to the side of the cone while the other
was brought into line with the su­ture be­tween two ad­ja­cent
whorls, another specific angle, the “sutural angle,” could
in like man­ner be re­corded. And, by the linear scale upon
the in­stru­ment, the rel­a­tive breadths of the con­sec­u­tive
whorls, and that of the ter­minal cham­ber to the rest of the
shell, might also, though some­what roughly, be de­ter­mined.
For instance, in <i>Terebra dimidiata</i>, the apical angle was
found to be 13°, the sutural angle 109°, and so forth.</p>

<p>It was at once obvious that, in such a shell as is
rep­re­sent­ed in Fig. <a href="#fig267" title="go to Fig. 267">267</a> the en­tire out­line of the shell
(always ex­cept­ing that of the im­mediate neigh­bour­hood of
<span class="xxpn" id="p530">{530}</span> the mouth) could
be restored from a broken fragment. For if we draw our
tangents to the cone, it follows from the sym­metry of the
figure that we can con­tin­ue the pro­jec­tion of the sutural
line, and so mark off the suc­ces­sive whorls, by simply
drawing a series of con­sec­u­tive parallels, and by then
filling into the quad­ri­lat­erals so marked off a series of
curves similar to one another, and to the whorls which are
still intact in the broken shell. <br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<p>But the use of the helicometer soon shewed that it was by no
means universally the case that one and the same right cone was
tangent to all the turbinate whorls; in other words, there was not
always one specific apical angle which held good for the entire
system. In the great majority of cases, it is true, the same
tangent touches all the whorls, and is a straight line. But in
others, as in the large <i>Cerithium nodosum</i>, such a line is slightly
convex to the axis of the shell; and in the short spire of Dolium,
for instance, the convexity is marked, and the apex of the spire
is a distinct cusp. On the other hand, in Pupa and Clausilia, the
common tangent is concave to the axis of the shell.</p>

<p>So also is it, as we shall presently see, among the Ammonites:
where there are some species in which the ratio of whorl to whorl
remains, to all appearance, perfectly constant; others in which
it gradually, though only slightly increases; and others again in
which it slightly and gradually falls away. It is obvious that,
among the manifold possibilities of growth, such conditions as
these are very easily conceivable. It is much more remarkable
that, among these shells, the relative velocities of growth in various
dimensions should be as constant as it is, than that there should
be an occasional departure from perfect regularity. In such cases
as these latter, the logarithmic law of growth is only ap­prox­i­mate­ly
true. The shell is no longer to be represented as a <i>right</i> cone
which has been rolled up, but as a cone which had grown trumpet-shaped,
or conversely whose mouth had narrowed in, and which
in section is a curvilinear instead of a rectilinear triangle. But
all that has happened is that a new factor, usually of small or all
but imperceptible magnitude, has been introduced into the case;
so that the ratio, log&#x202f;<i>r</i>
=&#x202f;θ&#x202f;log&#x202f;α, is no longer constant, but varies
slightly, and in accordance with
some simple law. <span class="xxpn" id="p531">{531}</span></p>

<p>Some writers, such as Naumann and Grabau, maintained that
the molluscan spiral was no true logarithmic spiral, but differed
from it specifically, and they gave to it the name of <i>Conchospiral</i>.
They pointed out that the logarithmic spiral originates in a
math­e­mat­i­cal point, while the molluscan shell starts with a little
embryonic shell, or central chamber (the “protoconch” of the
conchologists), around which the spiral is subsequently wrapped.
It is plain that this undoubted and obvious fact need not
affect the logarithmic law of the shell as a whole; we have
only to add a small constant to our equation, which becomes
<i>r</i>
=&#x202f;<i>m</i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;<i>a</i>&#xfeff;<sup>θ</sup>&#x202f;.</p>

<p>There would seem, by the way, to be considerable confusion
in the books with regard to the so-called “protoconch.” In many
cases it is a definite structure, of simple form, representing the
more or less globular embryonic shell before it began to elongate
into its conical or spiral form. But in many cases what is described
as the “protoconch” is merely an empty space in the middle of</p>

 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 268.</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">the spiral coil, resulting from
the fact that the actual spiral shell has a definite
magnitude to begin with, and that we cannot follow it down
to its vanishing point in infinity. For instance, in the
accompanying figure, the large space <i>a</i> is styled the
protoconch, but it is the little bulbous or hemispherical
chamber within it, at the end of the spire, which is
the real beginning of the tubular shell. The form and
magnitude of the space <i>a</i> are determined by the “angle of
retardation,” or ratio of rate of growth between the inner
and outer curves of the spiral shell. They are independent
of the shape and size of the embryo, and depend only (as we
shall see better presently) on the direction and relative
rate of growth of the double contour of the shell.<br

<p>Now that we have dealt, in a very general way, with some of
the more obvious properties of the logarithmic spiral, let us
consider certain of them a little more
particularly, keeping in <span class="xxpn" id="p532">{532}</span>
view as our chief object the in­ves­ti­ga­tion (on elementary lines)
of the possible manner and range of variation of the molluscan
shell.</p>

<div class="dmaths">
<p>There is yet another equation to the logarithmic spiral,
very commonly employed, and without the
help of which we shall find that we cannot
get far. It is as follows:</p>

<div><i>r</i>

<p>As we have seen throughout our preliminary discussion, the
two most important constants (or chief “specific characters,” as
the naturalist would say) in any given logarithmic spiral, are
(1) the magnitude of the angle of the spiral, or “constant angle,”
α, and (2) the rate of increase of the radius vector for any given
angle of revolution, θ. Of this latter, the simplest case is when
θ
=&#x202f;2π, or 360°; that is to say when we compare the breadths,
along the same radius vector, of two successive whorls. As our
two magnitudes, that of the constant angle, and that of the ratio
of the radii or breadths of whorl, are related to one another, we
may determine either of them by actual measurement and proceed
to calculate the other.
<br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<div class="dmaths">
<p>In any complete spiral, such as that of Nautilus, it is (as we
have seen) easy to measure any two radii (<i>r</i>), or
the breadths in <span class="xxpn" id="p533">{533}</span>
a radial direction of any two whorls (<i>W</i>). We have then merely
to apply the formula</p>

<div><i>r</i>&#xfeff;<sub><i>n</i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;1</sub>&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>r&#xfeff;<sub>n</sub></i>

<p class="pcontinue">which we may simply write <i>r</i>
=&#x202f;<i>e</i>&#xfeff;<sup>θ&#x202f;cot&#x202f;α</sup>&#x202f;, etc.; since our first radius
or whorl is regarded, for the purpose of comparison, as being equal
to unity.</p>
</div><!--dmaths-->

<p>Thus, in the diagram, <i>OC&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;OE</i>&#x202f;,
or <i>EF&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;BD</i>&#x202f;, or
<i>DC&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;EF</i>&#x202f;, being in each case radii, or

<i>e</i>&#xfeff;<sup>(π&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;2)&#x202f;cot&#x202f;α</sup>&#x202f;.

<p>As soon, then, as we have prepared tables for these values,
the determination of the constant angle α in a particular shell

<p>We learn several interesting things from this short table.
We see, in the first place, that where each whorl is about
three times the breadth of its neighbour and predecessor,
as is the case in Nautilus,</p>

<div class="dleft dwth-f" id="fig271">
<img src="images/i534.png" width="256" height="268" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 271.</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">
the constant angle is in the
neighbourhood of 80°; and hence also that, in all the
ordinary Ammonitoid shells, and in all the typically spiral
shells of the Gastropods<a class="afnanch" href="#fn514"
id="fnanch514">514</a>, the constant angle is also a large one,
being very seldom less than 80°, and usually between 80° and
85°. In the next place, we see that with smaller angles the
apparent form of the spiral is greatly altered, and the very
fact of its being a spiral soon ceases to be apparent (Figs.
<a href="#fig271" title="go to Fig. 271">271</a>, 272). Suppose one whorl to be an inch in breadth, then,
if the angle of the spiral were 80°, the <span class="xxpn"
id="p535">{535}</span> next whorl would (as we have just seen)
be about three inches broad; if it were 70°, the next whorl
would be nearly ten inches, and if it were 60°, the next whorl
would be nearly four feet broad. If the angle were 28°, the
next whorl would be a mile and a half in breadth; and if it
were 17°, the next would be some 15,000 miles broad.

<div class="dctr03" id="fig272">
<img src="images/i535a.png" width="609" height="241" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 272.</div></div>

<p>In other words, the spiral shells of gentle curvature, or of
small constant angle, such as Dentalium or Nodosaria, are true
logarithmic spirals, just as are those of Nautilus or Rotalia:
from which they differ only in degree, in the magnitude of an
angular constant. But this diminished magnitude of the angle
causes the spiral to dilate with such immense rapidity that, so
to speak, “it never comes round”; and so, in such a shell as
Dentalium, we never see but a small portion of the initial whorl.</p>

<div class="dctr03" id="fig273">
<img src="images/i535b.png" width="609" height="341" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 273.</div></div>

<div class="psmprnt3">
<p>We might perhaps be inclined to suppose that, in such a shell as Dentalium,
the lack of a visible spiral convolution was only due to our seeing but a small
portion of the curve, at a distance from the pole, and
when, therefore, its <span class="xxpn" id="p536">{536}</span>
curvature had already greatly diminished. That is to say we might suppose
that, however small the angle a, and however rapidly the whorls accordingly
increased, there would nevertheless be a manifest spiral convolution in the
immediate neighbourhood of the pole, as the starting point of the curve.
But it may be shewn that this is not so.</p>

<div class="dmaths">
<p>For, taking the formula</p>

<br class="brclrfix" /></div>

<p class="pcontinue">Then, if θ increase by 2π, while <i>r</i> increases to <i>r</i>&#xfeff;<sub>1</sub>&#x202f;,</p>

<p>Therefore if one whorl exists, the radius vector of the
other is infinite; in other words, there is nowhere, even in
the near neighbourhood of the pole, a complete revolution of
the spire. Our spiral shells of small constant angle, such
as Dentalium, may accordingly be considered to represent
sufficiently well the true commencement of their respective
spirals.</p>
</div><!--psmprnt3-->

<p>Let us return to the problem of how to ascertain, by direct
measurement, the spiral angle of any particular shell. The
method already employed is only applicable to complete spirals,
that is to say to those in which the angle of the spiral is large,
and furthermore it is inapplicable to portions, or broken fragments,
of a shell. In the case of the broken fragment, it is plain that the
determination of the angle is not merely of theoretic interest,
but may be of great practical use to the conchologist as being the
one and only way by which he may restore the outline of the
missing portions. We have a considerable choice of methods,
which have been summarised by, and are partly due to, a very
careful student of the Cephalopoda, the late
Rev. J. F. Blake<a class="afnanch" href="#fn515" id="fnanch515">515</a>.

<p>(1) The following method is useful and easy when we
have a portion of a single whorl, such as to shew both its
inner and its outer edge. A broken whorl of an Ammonite, a
curved shell such as Dentalium, or a horn of similar form
to the latter, will fall under this head. We have merely to
draw a tangent, <i>GEH</i>, to the outer whorl at any point <i>E</i>;
then draw to the inner whorl a tangent parallel to <i>GEH</i>,
touching the curve in some point <i>F</i>. The straight line
joining the points of contact, <i>EF</i>, must evidently pass
through the pole: and, accordingly, the angle <i>GEF</i> is the
angle required. In shells which bear <i>longitudinal</i> striae
or other ornaments, any pair of these will suffice for our
purpose, instead of the actual boundaries of the whorl.
But it is obvious that this method will be apt to fail us
when the angle α is very small; and when, consequently, the
points <i>E</i> and <i>F</i> are very remote. <br class="brclrfix"

<p>(2) In shells (or horns) shewing rings, or other <i>transverse</i>
ornamentation, we may take it that these ornaments are set at
a constant angle to the spire, and therefore to the radii. The angle
(θ) between two of them, as <i>AC</i>, <i>BD</i>, is therefore equal to the
angle θ between the polar radii from <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, or from <i>C</i> and <i>D</i>;
and therefore <i>BD&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;AC</i>

<li><p>(3) If only the outer edge be available, we have the ordinary
geometrical problem,—given an arc of an equiangular spiral, to
find its pole and spiral angle. The methods we may employ
depend (1) on determining directly the position of the pole, and
(2) on determining the radius of curvature.</p></li>

<p>Of all these methods by which the math­e­mat­i­cal constants,
or specific characters, of a given spiral shell may be determined,
the only one of which much use has been made is that which
Moseley first employed, namely, the simple
method of determining <span class="xxpn" id="p539">{539}</span>
the relative breadths of the whorl at distances separated by some
convenient vectorial angle (such as 90°, 180°, or 360°).</p>

been made by Naumann<a class="afnanch" href="#fn517" id="fnanch517">517</a>,
by Sandberger<a class="afnanch" href="#fn518" id="fnanch518">518</a>,

<p class="pcontinue"><i>intuslabiatus</i>; these measurements Grabau gives for every 45° of
arc, but I have only set forth one quarter of these measurements,
that is to say, the breadths of successive whorls measured along
one diameter on both sides of the pole. The ratio between
<i>alternate</i> measurements is therefore the same ratio as Moseley
adopted, namely the ratio of breadth between <i>contiguous whorls</i>
along a radius vector. I have then added to these observed
values the cor­re­spon­ding calculated values of the angle α, as
obtained from our usual formula.</p>

<p>There is considerable irregularity in the ratios derived from
these measurements, but it will be seen that this irregularity only
implies a variation of the angle of the spiral between about 85°
and 87°; and the values fluctuate pretty regularly about the
mean, which is 86°&#x202f;15&#xfeff;′. Considering the difficulty of measuring
the whorls, especially towards the centre, and in particular the
difficulty of determining with precise accuracy the position of the
pole, it is clear that in such a case as this we are scarcely justified
in asserting that the law of the logarithmic spiral is departed from.</p>

<p>In some cases, however, it is undoubtedly departed from.
Here for instance is another table from Grabau, shewing the
cor­re­spon­ding ratios in an Ammonite of the group of <i>Arcestes

<p class="pcontinue">increase as we pass from the centre of the coil outwards, and
consequently for the values of the angle α to diminish. The case
is precisely comparable to that of a cone with slightly curving
sides: in which, that is to say, there is a slight acceleration
of growth in a transverse as compared with the longitudinal
direction.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>In a tubular spiral, whether plane or helicoid, the consecutive
whorls may either be (1) isolated and remote from one another;
or (2) they may precisely meet, so that the outer border of one
and the inner border of the next just coincide; or (3) they may
overlap, the vector plane of each outer whorl cutting that of its
immediate predecessor or predecessors.</p>

<p>Looking, as we have done, upon the spiral shell as being
essentially a cone rolled up, it is plain that, for a given spiral
angle, intersection or non-intersection of the successive whorls
will depend upon <i>the apical angle</i> of the original cone. For the
wider the cone, the more rapidly will its inner border tend to
encroach on the outer border of the preceding whorl.</p>

<p>But it is also plain that the greater be the apical angle of the
cone, and the broader, consequently, the cone itself be, the greater
difference will there be between the total <i>lengths</i> of its inner and
outer border, under given conditions of flexure. And, since the
inner and outer borders are describing precisely the same spiral
about the pole, it is plain that we may consider the inner border
as being <i>retarded</i> in growth as compared with the outer, and as
being always identical with a smaller and earlier part of the
latter.</p>

<p>We see, accordingly, that in plane spirals whose constant
angle lies, say, between 65° and 70°, we can only obtain
contact between consecutive whorls if the rate of growth of
the inner border of the tube be a small fraction,—a tenth or
a twentieth—of that of the outer border. In spirals whose
constant angle is 80°, contact is attained when the respective
rates of growth are, ap­prox­i­mate­ly, as 3 to 1; while in spirals
of constant angle from about 85° to 89°, contact is attained

<p class="pcontinue">it is evident that when β
=&#x202f;2π, that will mean that λ
=&#x202f;1. In
other words, the outer and inner borders of the tube are identical,
and the tube is constituted by one continuous line.</p>
</div><!--dmaths-->

<p>When λ is a very small fraction, that is to say when the rates
of growth of the two borders of the tube are very diverse, then
β will tend towards infinity—tend that is to say towards a condition
in which the inner border of the tube never grows at all.
This condition is not infrequently approached in nature. The
nearly parallel-sided cone of Dentalium, or the widely separated
whorls of Lituites, are evidently cases where λ nearly approaches
unity in the one case, and is still large in the other, β being
correspondingly small; while we can easily find cases where β is
very large, and λ is a small fraction, for instance in Haliotis, or
in Gryphaea.</p>

<p>For the purposes of the morphologist, then, the main result
of this last general in­ves­ti­ga­tion is to shew that all the various
types of “open” and “closed” spirals, all the various degrees of
separation or overlap of the successive whorls, are simply the
outward expression of a varying ratio in the <i>rate of growth</i> of the
outer as compared with the inner border of the tubular shell.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The foregoing problem of contact, or intersection, of the successive
whorls, is a very simple one in the case of the discoid shell
but a more complex one in the turbinate. For in the discoid shell
contact will evidently take place when the retardation of the
inner as compared with the outer whorl is just 360°, and the
shape of the whorls need not be considered.</p>

<p>As the angle of retardation diminishes from 360°, the whorls
will stand further and further apart in an open coil; as it increases
beyond 360°, they will more and more overlap; and when the
angle of retardation is infinite, that is to say when the true inner
edge of the whorl does not grow at all, then the shell is said to
be completely involute. Of this latter condition we have a
striking example in Argonauta, and one a little more obscure in
<i>Nautilus pompilius</i>.</p>

<p>In the turbinate shell, the problem of contact is twofold, for
we have to deal with the possibilities of contact on the <i>same</i> side
of the axis (which is what we have dealt with in
the discoid) and <span class="xxpn" id="p547">{547}</span>
also with the new possibility of contact or intersection on the
<i>opposite</i> side; it is this latter case which will determine the
presence or absence of an <i>umbilicus</i>, and whether, if present, it
will be an open conical space or a twisted cone. It is further
obvious that, in the case of the turbinate, the question of contact
or no contact will depend on the shape of the generating curve;
and if we take the simple case where this generating curve may
be considered as an ellipse, then contact will be found to depend
on the angle which the major axis of this ellipse makes with the
axis of the shell. The question becomes a complicated one, and
the student will find it treated in Blake’s paper already referred to.</p>

<p>When one whorl overlaps another, so that the generating
curve cuts its predecessor (at a distance of 2π) on the same radius
vector, the locus of intersection will follow a spiral line upon the
shell, which is called the “suture” by conchologists. It is evidently
one of that <i>ensemble</i> of spiral lines in space of which, as we have
seen, the whole shell may be conceived to be constituted; and we
might call it a “contact-spiral,” or “spiral of intersection.” In
discoid shells, such as an Ammonite or a Planorbis, or in <i>Nautilus
umbilicatus</i>, there are obviously two such contact-spirals, one on
each side of the shell, that is to say one on each side of a plane
perpendicular to the axis. In turbinate shells such a condition
is also possible, but is somewhat rare. We have it for instance,
in <i>Solarium perspectivum</i>, where the one contact-spiral is visible
on the exterior of the cone, and the other lies internally,
winding round the open cone of the umbilicus<a class="afnanch" href="#fn521" id="fnanch521">521</a>;
but this second
contact-spiral is usually imaginary, or concealed within the
whorls of the turbinated shell. Again, in Haliotis, one of the
contact-spirals is non-existent, because of the extreme obliquity
of the plane of the generating curve. In <i>Scalaria pretiosa</i> and
in Spirula there is no contact-spiral, because the growth of the
generating curve has been too slow, in comparison with the vector
rotation of its plane. In Argonauta and in Cypraea, there is no
contact-spiral, because the growth of the generating curve has
been too quick. Nor, of course, is there any contact-spiral in
Patella or in Dentalium, because the angle α is too small ever to
give us a complete revolution of the spire. <span class="xxpn" id="p548">{548}</span></p>

<p>The various forms of straight or spiral shells among the
Cephalopods, which we have seen to be capable of complete
definition by the help of elementary mathematics, have received
a very complicated descriptive nomenclature from the palaeontologists.
For instance, the straight cones are spoken of as
<i>orthoceracones</i> or <i>bactriticones</i>, the loosely coiled forms as <i>gyroceracones</i>
or <i>mimoceracones</i>, the more closely coiled shells, in which
one whorl overlaps the other, as <i>nautilicones</i> or <i>ammoniticones</i>,
and so forth. In such a succession of forms the biologist sees
undoubted and unquestioned evidence of ancestral descent. For
instance we read in Zittel’s <i>Palaeontology</i><a class="afnanch" href="#fn522" id="fnanch522">522</a>:
“The bactriticone
obviously represents the primitive or primary radical of the
Ammonoidea, and the mimoceracone the next or secondary radical
of this order”; while precisely the opposite conclusion was drawn
by Owen, who supposed that the straight chambered shells of
such fossil cephalopods as Orthoceras had been produced by the
gradual unwinding of a coiled nautiloid shell<a class="afnanch" href="#fn523" id="fnanch523">523</a>.
<i>To such phylogenetic
hypotheses the math­e­mat­i­cal or dynamical study of the forms of
shells lends no valid support.</i> If we have two shells in which the
constant angle of the spire be respectively 80° and 60°, that fact
in itself does not at all justify an assertion that the one is more
primitive, more ancient, or more “ancestral” than the other.
Nor, if we find a third in which the angle happens to be 70°,
does that fact entitle us to say that this shell is intermediate
between the other two, in time, or in blood relationship, or in
any other sense whatsoever save only the strictly formal and
math­e­mat­i­cal one. For it is evident that, though these particular
arithmetical constants manifest themselves in visible and recognisable
differences of form, yet they are not necessarily more
deep-seated or significant than are those which manifest themselves
only in difference of magnitude; and the student of
phylogeny scarcely ventures to draw conclusions as to the relative
antiquity of two allied organisms on the ground that one happens
to be bigger or less, or longer or shorter, than the other. <span class="xxpn" id="p549">{549}</span></p>

<p>At the same time, while it is obviously unsafe to rest conclusions
upon such features as these, unless they be strongly supported
and corroborated in other ways,—for the simple reason that there
is unlimited room for <i>coincidence</i>, or separate and independent
attainment of this or that magnitude or numerical ratio,—yet on
the other hand it is certain that, in particular cases, the evolution
of a race has actually involved gradual increase or decrease in
some one or more numerical factors, magnitude itself included,—that
is to say increase or decrease in some one or more of the
actual and relative velocities of growth. When we do meet with
a clear and unmistakable series of such progressive magnitudes or
ratios, manifesting themselves in a progressive series of “allied”
forms, then we have the phenomenon of “<i>orthogenesis</i>.” For
orthogenesis is simply that phenomenon of continuous lines or
series of form (and also of functional or physiological capacity),
which was the foundation of the Theory of Evolution, alike to
Lamarck and to Darwin and Wallace; and which we see to exist
whatever be our ideas of the “origin of species,” or of the nature
and origin of “functional adaptations.” And to my mind, the
math­e­mat­i­cal (as distinguished from the purely physical) study
of morphology bids fair to help us to recognise this phenomenon
of orthogenesis in many cases where it is not at once patent to
the eye; and also, on the other hand, to warn us, in many other
cases, that even strong and apparently complex resemblances in
form may be capable of arising independently, and may sometimes
signify no more than the equally accidental numerical coincidences
which are manifested in identity of length or weight, or any other
simple magnitudes.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>I have already referred to the fact that, while in general a
very great and remarkable regularity of form is char­ac­ter­is­tic of
the molluscan shell, that complete regularity is apt to be departed
from. We have clear cases of such a departure in Pupa, Clausilia,
and various Bulimi, where the enveloping cone of the spire is
not a right cone but a cone whose sides are curved. It is plain
that this condition may arise in two ways: either by a gradual
change in the ratio of growth of the whorls, that is to say in
the logarithmic spiral itself, or by a change in
the velocity of <span class="xxpn" id="p550">{550}</span>
translation along the axis, that is to say in the helicoid which,
in all turbinate shells, is superposed upon the spiral. Very careful
measurements will be necessary to determine to which of these
factors, or in what proportions to each, the phenomenon is due.
But in many Ammonitoidea where the helicoid factor does not
enter into the case, we have a clear illustration of gradual and
marked changes in the spiral angle itself, that is to say of the ratio
of growth cor­re­spon­ding to increase of vectorial angle. We have
seen from some of Naumann’s and Grabau’s measurements that
such a tendency to vary, such an acceleration or retardation,
may be detected even in Ammonites which present nothing
abnormal to the eye. But let us suppose that the spiral angle
increases somewhat rapidly; we shall then get a spiral with
gradually narrowing whorls, and this condition is char­ac­ter­is­tic</p>

<p class="pcontinue">
of Oekotraustes, a subgenus of Ammonites. If on the other hand,
the angle α gradually diminishes, and even falls away to zero, we
shall have the spiral curve opening out, as it does in Scaphites,
Ancyloceras and Lituites, until the spiral coil is replaced by a spiral
curve so gentle as to seem all but straight. Lastly, there are a
few cases, such as <i>Bellerophon expansus</i> and some Goniatites,
where the outer spiral does not perceptibly change, but the whorls
become more “embracing” or the whole shell more involute.
Here it is the angle of retardation, the ratio of growth between
the outer and inner parts of the whorl, which undergoes a gradual
change.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>In order to understand the relation of a close-coiled shell
to one of its straighter congeners, to compare (for example)
an <span class="xxpn" id="p551">{551}</span> Ammonite with
an Orthoceras, it is necessary to estimate the length of
the right cone which has, so to speak, been coiled up into
the spiral shell. Our problem then is, To find the length
of a plane logarithmic spiral, in terms of the radius and
the constant angle α. In the annexed diagram, if <i>OP</i> be a
radius vector, <i>OQ</i> a line of reference perpendicular to <i>OP</i>,
and <i>PQ</i> a tangent to the curve, <i>PQ</i>, or sec&#x202f;α, is equal
in length to the spiral arc <i>OP</i>. And this is practically
obvious: for <i>PP&#xfeff;′&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;PR&#xfeff;′</i>
=&#x202f;<i>ds&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;dr</i>
=&#x202f;sec&#x202f;α, and
therefore sec&#x202f;α
=&#x202f;<i>s&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;r</i>, or the ratio of arc to radius

<p>Accordingly, we see that (1), when the constant angle of the
spiral is small, the spiral itself is scarcely distinguishable from
a straight line, and its length is but very little greater than that
of its own radius vector. This remains pretty much the case for
a considerable increase of angle, say from 0° to 20° or more;
(2) for a very considerably greater increase of the constant angle,
say to 50° or more, the shell would only have the appearance of
a gentle curve; (3) the char­ac­ter­is­tic close coils of the Nautilus
or Ammonite would be typically represented only when the
constant angle lies within a few degrees on either side of about
80°. The coiled up spiral of a Nautilus, with a constant angle
of about 80°, is about six times the length of its radius vector,
or rather more than three times its own diameter; while that of
an Ammonite, with a constant angle of, say, from 85° to 88°, is
from about six to fifteen times as long as its own diameter. And
(4) as we approach an angle of 90° (at which point the spiral
vanishes in a circle), the length of the coil increases with enormous
rapidity. Our spiral would soon assume the appearance of the
close coils of a Nummulite, and the successive increments of
breadth in the successive whorls would become inappreciable to
the eye. The logarithmic spiral of high constant angle would,
as we have already seen, tend to become in­dis­tin­guish­able, without
the most careful measurement, from an Archimedean spiral.
And it is obvious, moreover, that our
ordinary methods of <span class="xxpn" id="p553">{553}</span>
determining the constant angle of the spiral would not in these
cases be accurate enough to enable us to measure the length of
the coil: we should have to devise a new method, based on the
measurement of radii or diameters over a large number of whorls.</p>

<p>The geometrical form of the shell involves many other beautiful
properties, of great interest to the mathematician, but which it
is not possible to reduce to such simple expressions as we have
been content to use. For instance, we may obtain an equation
which shall express completely the surface of any shell, in terms
of polar or of rectangular coordinates (as has been done by Moseley
and by Blake), or in Hamiltonian vector notation. It is likewise
possible (though of little interest to the naturalist) to determine
the area of a conchoidal surface, or the volume of a conchoidal
solid, and to find the centre of gravity of either surface or
solid<a class="afnanch" href="#fn524" id="fnanch524">524</a>.
And Blake has further shewn, with considerable elaboration, how
we may deal with the symmetrical distortion, due to pressure,
which fossil shells are often found to have undergone, and how
we may reconstitute by calculation their original undistorted
form,—a problem which, were the available methods only a little
easier, would be very helpful to the palaeontologist; for, as
Blake himself has shewn, it is easy to mistake a symmetrically
distorted specimen of (for instance) an Ammonite, for a new and
distinct species of the same genus. But it is evident that to deal
fully with the math­e­mat­i­cal problems contained in, or suggested
by, the spiral shell, would require a whole treatise, rather than
a single chapter of this elementary book. Let us then, leaving
mathematics aside, attempt to summarise, and perhaps to extend,
what has been said about the general possibilities of form in this
class of organisms.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3><i>The Univalve Shell: a summary.</i></h3></div>

<p>The surface of any shell, whether discoid or turbinate, may be
imagined to be generated by the revolution about a fixed axis of
a closed curve, which, remaining always geometrically similar to
itself, increases continually its dimensions: and, since the rate of
growth of the generating curve and its velocity of rotation follow
the same law, the curve traced in space by
cor­re­spon­ding points <span class="xxpn" id="p554">{554}</span>
in the generating curve is, in all cases, a logarithmic spiral. In
discoid shells, the generating figure revolves in a plane perpendicular
to the axis, as in Nautilus, the Argonaut and the Ammonite.
In turbinate shells, it slides continually along the axis of revolution,
and the curve in space generated by any given point partakes,
therefore, of the character of a helix, as well as of a logarithmic
spiral; it may be strictly entitled a helico-spiral. Such turbinate
or helico-spiral shells include the snail, the periwinkle and all the
common typical Gastropods.</p>

<p>The generating figure, as represented by the mouth of the
shell, is sometimes a plane curve, of simple form; in other and
more numerous cases, it becomes more complicated in form and
its boundaries do not lie in one plane: but in such cases as these
we</p>

 Woodward.)</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">
may replace it by its “trace,” on a
plane at some definite angle to the direction
of growth, for instance by its form as it
appears in a section through the axis of
the heli­coid shell. The gen­er­ating curve
is of very various shapes. It is circular
in Scalaria or Cyclostoma, and in Spirula;
it may be con­si­dered as a seg­ment of a
circle in Natica or in Plan­orbis. It is
ap­prox­i­mate­ly tri­an­gular in Conus, and
rhom­boidal in Solarium or Potam­ides. It
is very com­monly more or less elliptical:
the long axis of the el­lipse being parallel
to the axis of the shell in Oliva and Cypraea;
all but per­pen­di­cu­lar to it in many Trochi;
and oblique to it in many well-marked
cases, such as Sto­ma­tella, La­mel­laria,
<i>Si­gar­etus hal­io­toides</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig284" title="go to Fig. 284">284</a>) and Haliotis.
In <i>Nautilus pom­pi­lius</i> it is ap­prox­i­mate­ly
a semi-ellipse, and in <i>N. um­bil­i­catus</i> rather
more than a semi-ellipse, the long axis
lying in both cases per­pen­di­cu­lar to the axis
of the shell<a class="afnanch" href="#fn525" id="fnanch525">525</a>.
Its <span class="xxpn" id="p555">{555}</span>
form is seldom open to easy math­e­mat­i­cal ex­pres­sion, save when
it is an actual circle or ellipse; but an exception to this rule may
be found in certain Am­mo­nites, for­ming the group “Cordati,”
where (as Blake points out) the curve is very nearly rep­re­sent­ed
by a cardioid, whose equation is <i>r</i>
=&#x202f;<i>a</i>(1&#x202f;+&#x202f;cos&#x202f;θ).
<br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<p>The generating curve may grow slowly or quickly; its growth-factor
is very slow in Dentalium or Turritella, very rapid in Nerita,
or Pileopsis, or Haliotis or the Limpet. It may contain the axis
in its plane, as in Nautilus; it may be parallel to the axis, as in
the majority of Gastropods; or it may be inclined to the axis, as
it is in a very marked degree in Haliotis. In fact, in Haliotis
the generating curve is so oblique to the axis of the shell that
the latter appears to grow by additions to one margin only (cf.
Fig. <a href="#fig258" title="go to Fig. 258">258</a>), as in the case of the opercula of Turbo and Nerita
referred to on p. <a href="#p522" title="go to pg. 522">522</a>; and this is what Moseley supposed it to do.</p>

<div class="dctr02" id="fig284">
<img src="images/i555.png" width="705" height="219" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 284. <i>A, Lamellaria
 perspicua; B, Sigaretus haliotoides.</i><br />(After
 Woodward.)</div></div>

<p>The general appearance of the entire shell is determined (apart
from the form of its generating curve) by the magnitude of three
angles; and these in turn are determined, as has been sufficiently
explained, by the ratios of certain velocities of growth. These
angles are (1) the constant angle of the logarithmic spiral (α);
(2) in turbinate shells, the enveloping angle of the cone, or (taking
half that angle) the angle (θ) which a tangent to the whorls makes
with the axis of the shell; and (3) an angle called the “angle of
retardation” (β), which expresses the retardation
in growth of <span class="xxpn" id="p556">{556}</span>
the inner as compared with the outer part of each whorl, and
therefore measures the extent to which one whorl overlaps, or the
extent to which it is separated from, another.</p>

<p>The spiral angle (α) is very small in a limpet, where it is usually
taken as
=&#x202f;0°; but it is evidently of a significant amount, though
obscured by the shortness of the tubular shell. In Dentalium
it is still small, but sufficient to give the appearance of a regular
curve; it amounts here probably to about 30° to 40°. In Haliotis
it is from about 70° to 75°; in Nautilus about 80°; and it lies
between 80° and 85°, or even more, in the majority of Gastropods.</p>

<p>The case of Fissurella is curious. Here we have, apparently,
a conical shell with no trace of spiral curvature, or (in other
words) with a spiral angle which approximates to 0°; but in the
minute embryonic shell (as in that of the limpet) a spiral convolution
is distinctly to be seen. It would seem, then, that what we have
to do with here is an unusually large growth-factor in the generating
curve, which causes the shell to dilate into a cone of very wide
angle, the apical portion of which has become lost or absorbed,
and the remaining part of which is too short to show clearly its
intrinsic curvature. In the closely allied Emarginula, there is
likewise a well-marked spiral in the embryo, which however is
still manifested in the curvature of the adult, nearly conical, shell.
In both cases we have to do with a very wide-angled cone, and
with a high retardation-factor for its inner, or posterior, border.
The series is continued, from the apparently simple cone to the
complete spiral, through such forms as Calyptraea.</p>

<p>The angle α, as we have seen, is not always, nor rigorously,
a constant angle. In some Ammonites it may increase with age,
the whorls becoming closer and closer; in others it may decrease
rapidly, and even fall to zero, the coiled shell then straightening
out, as in Lituites and similar forms. It diminishes somewhat,
also, in many Orthocerata, which are slightly curved in youth,
but straight in age. It tends to increase notably in some common
land-shells, the Pupae and Bulimi; and it decreases in Succinea.</p>

<p>Directly related to the angle α is the ratio which subsists
between the breadths of successive whorls. The following table
gives a few illustrations of this ratio in particular cases,
in addition to those which we have already studied. <span
class="xxpn" id="p557">{557}</span></p>

<p>We see from this that shells so different in appearance as
Cerithium, Solarium, Natica and Planorbis differ very little indeed
in the magnitude of the spiral angle α, that is to say in the relative
velocities of radial and tangential growth. It is upon the angle θ</p>

<div class="dright dwth-e" id="fig285">
<img src="images/i559.png" width="337" height="569" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 285. <i>Terebra maculata</i>, L.</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">
that the difference in their form
mainly depends: that is to say the
amount of longitudinal shearing,
or displacement parallel to the axis
of the shell.</p>

<p>The enveloping angle, or rather
semi-angle (θ), of the cone may be
taken as 90° in the discoid shells,
such as Nautilus and Planorbis. It
is still a large angle, of 70° or 75°,
in Conus or in Cymba, somewhat
less in Cassis, Harpa, Dolium or
Natica; it is about 50° to 55° in
the various species of Solarium,
about 35° in the typical Trochi,
such as <i>T. niloticus</i> or <i>T. zizyphinus</i>,
and about 25° or 26° in <i>Scalaria
pretiosa</i> and <i>Phasianella bulloides</i>; it
becomes a very acute angle, of
15°, 10°, or even less, in Eulima,
Turritella or Cerithium. The costly <i>Conus gloria-maris</i>,
one of the <span class="xxpn" id="p560">{560}</span>
great treasures of the conchologist, differs from its congeners in
no important particular save in the somewhat “produced” spire,
that is to say in the comparatively low value of the angle θ.
<br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<p>A variation with advancing age of θ is common, but (as Blake
points out) it is often not to be distinguished or disentangled from
an alteration of α. Whether alone, or combined with a change in
α, we find it in all those many Gastropods whose whorls cannot
all be touched by the same enveloping cone, and whose spire is
accordingly described as <i>concave</i> or <i>convex</i>. The former condition,
as we have it in Cerithium, and in the cusp-like spire of Cassis,</p>

<p class="pcontinue">
Dolium and some Cones, is much the commoner of the two.
And such tendency to decrease may lead to θ becoming a negative
angle; in which case we have a depressed spire, as in the
Cypraeae.</p>

<p>When we find a “reversed shell,” a whelk or a snail for instance
whose spire winds to the left instead of to the right, we may
describe it math­e­mat­i­cally by the simple statement that the angle
θ has <i>changed sign</i>. In the genus Ampullaria, or Apple-snails,
inhabiting tropical or sub-tropical rivers, we have a remarkable
condition; for in certain “species” the spiral turns to the right,
in others to the left, and in others again we
have a flattened <span class="xxpn" id="p561">{561}</span>
“discoid” shell; and furthermore we have numerous intermediate
stages, on either side, shewing right and left-handed spirals of
varying degrees of acuteness<a class="afnanch" href="#fn527" id="fnanch527">527</a>.
In this case, the angle θ may be
said to vary, within the limits of a genus, from somewhere about
35° to somewhere about 125°.</p>

<p>The angle of retardation (β) is very small in Dentalium and
Patella; it is very large in Haliotis. It becomes infinite in
Argonauta and in Cypraea. Connected with the angle of retardation
are the various possibilities of contact or separation, in various
degrees, between adjacent whorls in the discoid, and between
both adjacent and opposite whorls in the turbinated shell. But
with these phenomena we have already dealt sufficiently.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3><i>Of Bivalve Shells.</i></h3></div>

<p>Hitherto we have dealt only with univalve shells, and it is in
these that all the math­e­mat­i­cal problems connected with the
spiral, or helico-spiral, are best illustrated. But the case of the
bivalve shell, of Lamellibranchs or of Brachiopods, presents no
essential difference, save only that we have here to do with two
conjugate spirals, whose two axes have a definite relation to one
another, and some freedom of rotatory movement relatively to
one another.</p>

<p>The generating curve is particularly well seen in the bivalve,
where it simply constitutes what we call “the outline of the shell.”
It is for the most part a plane curve, but not always; for there
are forms, such as Hippopus, Tridacna and many Cockles, or
Rhynchonella and Spirifer among the Brachiopods, in which the
edges of the two valves interlock, and others, such as Pholas,
Mya, etc., where in part they fail to meet. In such cases as these
the generating curves are conjugate, having a similar relation, but
of opposite sign, to a median plane of reference. A great variety
of form is exhibited by these generating curves among the bivalves.
In a good many cases the curve is ap­prox­i­mate­ly circular, as in
Anomia, Cyclas, Artemis, Isocardia; it is nearly semi-circular in
Argiope. It is ap­prox­i­mate­ly elliptical in Orthis and in Anodon;
it may be called semi-elliptical in Spirifer. It is
a nearly rectilinear <span class="xxpn" id="p562">{562}</span>
triangle in Lithocardium, and a curvilinear triangle in Mactra.
Many apparently diverse but more or less related forms may be
shewn to be deformations of a common type, by a simple application
of the math­e­mat­i­cal theory of “Transformations,” which we
shall have to study in a later chapter. In such a series as is
furnished, for instance, by Gervillea, Perna, Avicula, Modiola,
Mytilus, etc., a “simple shear” accounts for most, if not all, of
the apparent differences.</p>

<p>Upon the surface of the bivalve shell we usually see with great
clearness the “lines of growth” which represent the successive
margins of the shell, or in other words the successive positions
assumed during growth by the growing generating curve; and
we have a good illustration, accordingly, of how it is char­ac­ter­is­tic
of the generating curve that it should constantly increase, while
never altering its geometric similarity.</p>

<p>Underlying these “lines of growth,” which are so char­ac­ter­is­tic
of a molluscan shell (and of not a few other organic formations),
there is, then, a “law of growth” which we may attempt to enquire
into and which may be illustrated in various ways. The simplest
cases are those in which we can study the lines of growth on a
more or less flattened shell, such as the one valve of an oyster,
a Pecten or a Tellina, or some such bivalve mollusc. Here around
an origin, the so-called “umbo” of the shell, we have a series of
curves, sometimes nearly circular, sometimes elliptical, and often
asymmetrical; and such curves are obviously not “concentric,”
though we are often apt to call them so, but are always “co-axial.”
This manner of arrangement may be illustrated by various
analogies. We might for instance compare it to a series of waves,
radiating outwards from a point, through a medium which offered
a resistance increasing, with the angle of divergence, according to
some simple law. We may find another, and perhaps a simpler
illustration as follows:</p>

<p>In a very simple and beautiful theorem, Galileo shewed
that, if we imagine a number of inclined planes, or
gutters, sloping downwards (in a vertical plane) at various
angles from a common starting-point, and if we imagine a
number of balls rolling each down its own gutter under the
influence of gravity (and without hindrance from friction),
then, at any given instant, the locus of <span class="xxpn"
id="p563">{563}</span> all these moving bodies is a circle
passing through the point of origin. For the acceleration
along any one of the sloping paths, for instance <i>AB</i> (Fig.

that <br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<p>That is to say, all the balls reach the circumference
of the circle at the same moment as the ball which drops
vertically from <i>A</i> to <i>C</i>.</p>

<p>Where, then, as often happens, the generating curve of the
shell is ap­prox­i­mate­ly a circle passing through the point of origin,
we may consider the acceleration of growth along various radiants
to be governed by a simple math­e­mat­i­cal law, closely akin to
that simple law of acceleration which governs the movements of
a falling body. And, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, a similar definite law
underlies the cases where the generating curve is continually
elliptical, or where it assumes some more complex, but still regular

dif­ficult to intro­duce a cons­tant into our equa­tion to meet
the case of a shell which is somewhat unsymmetrical on either
side of the median axis. It is a somewhat more troublesome
matter, however, to bring these con­fi­gur­a­tions into relation
with a “law of growth,” as was so easily done in the case of
the circular figure: in other words, to <span class="xxpn"
id="p565">{565}</span> formulate a law of acceleration
according to which points starting from the origin <i>O</i>, and
moving along radial lines, would all lie, at any future epoch,
on an ellipse passing through <i>O</i>; and this calculation we need
not enter into. <br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<div class="dctr01" id="fig289">
<img src="images/i565.png" width="800" height="407" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 289.</div></div>

<p>All that we are immediately concerned with is the simple fact
that where a velocity, such as our rate of growth, varies with its
direction,—varies that is to say as a function of the angular
divergence from a certain axis,—then, in a certain simple case,
we get lines of growth laid down as a system of coaxial circles,
and, when the function is a more complex one, as a system of
ellipses or of other more complicated coaxial figures, which figures
may or may not be symmetrical on either side of the axis. Among
our bivalve mollusca we shall find the lines of growth to be
ap­prox­i­mate­ly circular in, for instance, Anomia; in Lima (e.g.
<i>L. subauriculata</i>) we have a system of nearly symmetrical ellipses
with the vertical axis about twice the transverse; in <i>Solen pellucidus</i>,
we have again a system of lines of growth which are not far
from being symmetrical ellipses, in which however the transverse
is between three and four times as great as the vertical axis. In
the great majority of cases, we have a similar phenomenon with
the further complication of slight, but occasionally very considerable,
lateral asymmetry.</p>

<p>In certain little Crustacea (of the genus Estheria) the carapace
takes the form of a bivalve shell, closely simulating
that of a <span class="xxpn" id="p566">{566}</span>
lamellibranchiate mollusc, and bearing lines of growth in all
respects analogous to or even identical with those of the latter.
The explanation is very curious and interesting. In ordinary
Crustacea the carapace, like the rest of the chitinised and calcified
integument, is shed off in successive moults, and is restored again
as a whole. But in Estheria (and one or two other small crustacea)
the moult is incomplete: the old carapace is retained, and the
new, growing up underneath it, adheres to it like a lining, and
projects beyond its edge: so that in course of time the margins
of successive old carapaces appear as “lines of growth” upon the
surface of the shell. In this mode of formation, then (but not
in the usual one), we obtain a structure which “is partly old and
partly new,” and whose successive increments are all similar,
similarly situated, and enlarged in a continued progression. We
have, in short, all the conditions appropriate and necessary for
the development of a logarithmic spiral; and this logarithmic
spiral (though it is one of small angle) gives its own character to
the structure, and causes the little carapace to partake of the
char­ac­ter­is­tic conformation of the molluscan shell.</p>

<p>The essential simplicity, as well as the great regularity of the
“curves of growth” which result in the familiar con­fi­gur­a­tions of
our bivalve shells, sufficiently explain, in a general way, the ease
with which they may be imitated, as for instance in the so-called
“artificial shells” which Kappers has produced from the conchoidal
form and lamination of lumps of melted and quickly cooled
paraffin<a class="afnanch" href="#fn528" id="fnanch528">528</a>.</p>

<div class="psmprnt3">
<p>In the above account of the math­e­mat­i­cal form of the bivalve shell, we
have supposed, for simplicity’s sake, that the pole or origin of the system is
at a point where all the successive curves touch one another. But such an
arrangement is neither theoretically probable, nor is it actually the case;
for it would mean that in a certain direction growth fell, not merely to a
minimum, but to zero. As a matter of fact, the centre of the system (the
“umbo” of the conchologists) lies not at the edge of the system, but very
near to it; in other words, there is a certain amount of growth all round.
But to take account of this condition would involve more troublesome mathematics,
and it is obvious that the foregoing illustrations are a sufficiently near
approximation to the actual case. <span class="xxpn" id="p567">{567}</span></p>

<p>Among the bivalves the spiral angle (α) is very small in the
flattened shells, such as Orthis, Lingula or Anomia. It is larger,
as a rule, in the Lamellibranchs than in the Brachiopods, but in
the latter it is of considerable magnitude among the Pentameri.
Among the Lamellibranchs it is largest in such forms as Isocardia
and Diceras, and in the very curious genus Caprinella; in all of
these last-named genera its magnitude leads to the production of
a spiral shell of several whorls, precisely as in the univalves. The
angle is usually equal, but of opposite sign, in the two valves of
the Lamellibranch, and usually of opposite sign but unequal in
the two valves of the Brachiopod. It is very unequal in many
Ostreidae, and especially in such forms as Gryphaea, or in Caprinella,
which is a kind of exaggerated Gryphaea. Occasionally it
is of the same sign in both valves (that is to say, both valves curve
the same way) as we see sometimes in Anomia, and much better
in Productus or Strophomena.</p>

<p>Owing to the large growth-factor of the generating curve, and
the comparatively small angle of the spiral, the whole shell seldom
assumes a spiral form so conspicuous as to manifest in a typical
way the helical twist or shear which is so
conspicuous in the <span class="xxpn" id="p568">{568}</span>
majority of univalves, or to let us measure or estimate the
magnitude of the apical angle (θ) of the enveloping cone. This
however we can do in forms like Isocardia and Diceras; while in
Caprinella we see that the whorls lie in a plane perpendicular to
the axis, forming a discoidal spire. As in the latter shell, so also
universally among the Brachiopods, there is no lateral asymmetry
in the plane of the generating curve such as to lead to the development
of a helix; but in the majority of the Lamellibranchiata
it is obvious, from the obliquity of the lines of growth, that the
angle θ is significant in amount.</p>

that of the valve to which it is
attached; and this curvature will tend
to be developed, by continuous and
symmetrical growth, into a fully
formed logarithmic spiral, so far as
it is permitted to do so under the
constraint of the shell in which it is
contained. In various Terebratulae we see the spiral growth of
the loop, more or less flattened and distorted by the restraining
pressure of the ventral valve. In a number of cases the loop
remains small, but gives off two nearly parallel branches or offshoots,
which continue to grow. And these, starting with just
such a slight curvature as the loop itself possessed, grow on and
on till they may form close-wound spirals, always provided that
the “spiral angle” of the curve is such that the resulting spire
can be freely contained within the cavity of the shell. Owing to
the bilateral symmetry of the whole system, the case will be rare,
and unlikely to occur, in which each separate arm will coil strictly

nearly so) and outwards from the middle line, will tend to constitute
a curve of double curvature, and so, on further growth,
to develop into a helicoid. This is what actually occurs, in the
great majority of cases. But the curvature may be such that
the helicoid grows outwards from the middle line, or inwards
towards the middle line, a <i>very</i> slight difference in the initial
curvature being sufficient to direct the spire the one way or the
other; the middle course of an undeviating discoid spire will be
rare, from the usual lack of any obvious controlling force to prevent
its deviation. The cases in which the helicoid spires point towards,
or point away from, the middle line are ascribed, in zoological
clas­si­fi­ca­tion, to particular “families” of Brachiopods, the former

incipient curvature of the arms, and consequently the form and
direction of the spirals, will be influenced by the surrounding
pressures, and these in turn by the general shape of the shell.
We shall expect, accordingly, to find the long outwardly directed
spirals associated with shells which are transversely elongated, as
Spirifer is; while the more rounded Atrypas will tend to the
opposite condition. In a few cases, as in Cyrtina or Reticularia,
where the shell is comparatively narrow but long, and where the
uncoiled basal support of the arms is long also, the spiral coils
into which the latter grow are turned backwards, in the direction
where there is room for them. And in the few cases where the
shell is very considerably flattened, the spirals (if
they find room <span class="xxpn" id="p570">{570}</span>
to grow at all) will be constrained to do so in a discoid or nearly
discoid fashion, and this is actually the case in such flattened
forms as Koninckina or Thecidium.</p>

<h3><i>The Shells of Pteropods.</i></h3></div>

<p>While math­e­mat­i­cally speaking we are entitled to look upon
the bivalve shell of the Lamellibranch as consisting of two distinct
elements, each comparable to the entire shell of the univalve, we
have no biological grounds for such a statement; for the shell
arises from a single embryonic origin, and afterwards becomes split
into portions which constitute the two separate valves. We can
perhaps throw some indirect light upon this phenomenon, and
upon several other phenomena connected with shell-growth, by
a consideration of the simple conical or tubular shells of the
Pteropods. The shells of the latter are in few cases suitable for
simple math­e­mat­i­cal in­ves­ti­ga­tion, but nevertheless they are of
very considerable interest in connection with our general problem.</p>

<p class="pcontinue">The morphology of the Pteropods is
by no means well understood, and in speaking of them I
will assume that there are still grounds for believing (in
spite of Boas’ and Pelseneer’s arguments) that they are
directly related to, or may at least be directly compared
with, the Cephalopoda<a class="afnanch" href="#fn529"
id="fnanch529">529</a>.</p>

<p>The simplest shells among the Pteropods have the form of
a tube, more or less cylindrical (Cuvierina), more often
conical (Creseis, Clio); and this tubular shell (as we have
already had occasion to remark, on p. <a href="#p258" title="go to pg. 258">258</a>), frequently
tends, when it is very small and delicate, to assume the
character of an unduloid. (In such a case it is more than
likely that the tiny shell, or that portion of it which
constitutes the unduloid, has not grown by successive <span
class="xxpn" id="p571">{571}</span> increments or “rings
of growth,” but has developed as a whole.) A thickened
“rib” is often, perhaps generally, present on the dorsal
side of the little conical shell. In a few cases (Limacina,
Peraclis) the tube becomes spirally coiled, in a normal
logarithmic spiral or helico-spiral. <br class="brclrfix"

<p>In certain cases (e.g. Cleodora, Hyalaea) the tube or cone is
curiously modified. In the first place,
its cross-section, originally <span class="xxpn" id="p572">{572}</span>
circular or nearly so, becomes flattened or compressed dorso-ventrally;
and the angle, or rather edge, where dorsal and ventral
walls meet, becomes more and more drawn out into a ridge or
keel. Along the free margin, both of the dorsal and the ventral
portion of the shell, growth proceeds with a regularly varying
velocity, so that these margins, or lips, of the shell become regularly
curved or markedly sinuous. At the same time, growth in a
transverse direction proceeds with an acceleration which manifests
itself in a curvature of the sides, replacing the straight borders of
the original cone. In other words, the cross-section of the cone,
or what we have been calling the generating curve, increases its
dimensions more rapidly than its distance from the pole.</p>

 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 298. <i>Cleodora cuspidata.</i></div></div>

<p>In the above figures, for instance in that of <i>Cleodora cuspidata</i>,
the markings of the shell which represent the successive edges of
the lip at former stages of growth, furnish us at once with a
“graph” of the varying velocities of growth as measured, radially,
from the apex. We can reveal more clearly the nature of these
variations in the following way which is simply tantamount to
converting our radial into rectangular coordinates. Neglecting
curvature (if any) of the sides and treating the shell (for simplicity’s
sake) as a right cone, we lay off equal angles from the apex <i>O</i>,
along the radii <i>Oa</i>, <i>Ob</i>, etc. If we then plot, as vertical equidistant
ordinates, the magnitudes <i>Oa</i>, <i>Ob</i> ... <i>OY</i>, and again on to
<i>Oa&#xfeff;′</i>, we obtain a diagram such as the following
(Fig. <a href="#fig299" title="go to Fig. 299">299</a>); by <span class="xxpn" id="p573">{573}</span>
help of which we not only see more clearly the way in which the
growth-rate varies from point to point, but we also recognise
much better than before, the similar nature of the law which
governs this variation in the different species.</p>

<p class="pcontinue">
to increase most rapidly in the median line, it follows
that the entire shell will appear to have been split into a dorsal
and a ventral plate, both connected with,
and projecting from, <span class="xxpn" id="p574">{574}</span>
what remains of the original undivided cone. Putting the same
thing in other words, we may say that the generating figure, which
lay at first in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the cone, has
now, by unequal growth, been sharply bent or folded, so as to
lie ap­prox­i­mate­ly in two planes, parallel to the anterior and
posterior faces of the cone. We have only to imagine the apical
connecting portion to be further reduced, and finally to disappear
or rupture, and we should have a <i>bivalve shell</i> developed out of
the original simple cone.</p>

<p>In its outer and growing portion, the shell of our Pteropod
now consists of two parts which, though still connected together
at the apex, may be treated as growing practically independently.
The shell is no longer a simple tube, or simple cone, in which
regular inequalities of growth will lead to the development of a
spiral; and this for the simple reason that we have now two
opposite maxima of growth, instead of a maximum on the one side
and a minimum on the other side of our tubular shell. As a matter
of fact, the dorsal and the ventral plate tend to curve in opposite
directions, towards the middle line, the dorsal curving ventrally
and the ventral curving towards the dorsal side.</p>

<p>In the case of the Lamellibranch or the Brachiopod, it is quite
possible for both valves to grow into more or less pronounced
spirals, for the simple reason that they are <i>hinged</i> upon one another;
and each growing edge, instead of being brought to a standstill
by the growth of its opposite neighbour, is free to move out of
the way, by the rotation about the hinge of the plane in which
it lies.</p>

<p>But where, as in the Pteropod, there is no such hinge, the
dorsal and ventral halves of the shell (or dorsal and ventral
valves, if we may call them so), if they curved towards one
another (as they do in a cockle), would soon interfere with
one another’s progress, and the development of a pair of
conjugate spirals would become impossible. Nevertheless, there
is obviously, in both dorsal and ventral valve, a <i>tendency</i> to
the development of a spiral curve, that of the ventral valve
being more marked than that of the larger and overlapping
dorsal one, exactly as in the two unequal valves of Terebratula.
In many cases (e.g. <i>Cleodora cuspidata</i>), the dorsal
valve or plate, <span class="xxpn" id="p575">{575}</span>
strengthened and stiffened by its midrib, is nearly straight, while
the curvature of the other is well displayed. But the case will
be materially altered and simplified if growth be arrested or
retarded in either half of the shell. Suppose for instance that
the dorsal valve grew so slowly that after a while, in comparison
with the other, we might speak of it as being absent altogether:
or suppose that it merely became so reduced in relative size as to
form no impediment to the continued growth of the ventral one;
the latter would continue to grow in the direction of its natural
curvature, and would end by forming a complete and coiled
logarithmic spiral. It would be precisely analogous to the spiral
shell of Nautilus, and, in regard to its</p>

 <div class="pcaption">Fig. 301. Pteropod shells, from the side:

<p class="pcontinue">ventral position, concave
towards the dorsal side, it would even deserve to be called directly
homologous with it. Suppose, on the other hand, that the ventral
valve were to be greatly reduced, and even to disappear, the
dorsal valve would then pursue its unopposed growth; and, were
it to be markedly curved, it would come to form a logarithmic
spiral, concave towards the ventral side, as is the case in the shell
of Spirula<a class="afnanch" href="#fn530" id="fnanch530">530</a>.
Were the dorsal valve to be destitute of any marked
curvature (or in other words, to have but a low spiral angle), it
would form a simple plate, as in the shells of Sepia or Loligo. Indeed,
in the shells of these latter, and especially in that of Sepia,
we seem to recognise a manifest resemblance to the dorsal plate of
the Pteropod shell, as we have it (e.g.) in
Cleodora or Hyalaea; <span class="xxpn" id="p576">{576}</span>
the little “rostrum” of Sepia is but the apex of the primitive cone,
and the rounded anterior extremity has grown according to a law
precisely such as that which has produced the curved margin of
the dorsal valve in the Pteropod. The ventral portion of the
original cone is nearly, but not wholly, wanting. It is represented
by the so-called posterior wall of the “siphuncular space.” In
many decapod cuttle-fishes also (e.g. Todarodes, Illex, etc.) we
still see at the posterior end of the “pen,” a vestige of the primitive
cone, whose dorsal margin only has continued to grow; and the
same phenomenon, on an exaggerated scale, is represented in the
Belemnites.</p>

<p>It is not at all impossible that we may explain on the same
lines the development of the curious “operculum” of the Ammonites.
This consists of a single horny plate (<i>Anaptychus</i>), or of
a thicker, more calcified plate divided into two symmetrical
halves (<i>Aptychi</i>), often found inside the terminal chamber of the
Ammonite, and occasionally to be seen lying <i>in situ</i>, as an
operculum which partially closes the mouth of the shell; this
structure is known to exist even in connection with the early
embryonic shell. In form the Anaptychus, or the pair of conjoined
Aptychi, shew an upper and a lower border, the latter
strongly convex, the former sometimes slightly concave, sometimes
slightly convex, and usually shewing a median projection or
slightly developed rostrum. From this “rostral” border the
curves of growth start, and course round parallel to, finally
constituting, the convex border. It is this convex border which
fits into the free margin of the mouth of the Ammonite’s shell,
while the other is applied to and overlaps the preceding whorl of
the spire. Now this relationship is precisely what we should
expect, were we to imagine as our starting-point a shell similar
to that of Hyalaea, in which however the dorsal part of the split
cone had become separate from the ventral half, had remained
flat, and had grown comparatively slowly, while at the same time
it kept slipping forward over the growing and coiling spire into
which the ventral half of the original shell develops<a class="afnanch" href="#fn531" id="fnanch531">531</a>.
In short,
I think there is reason to believe, or at least
to suspect, that we <span class="xxpn" id="p577">{577}</span>
have in the shell and Aptychus of the Ammonites, two portions
of a once united structure; of which other Cephalopods retain
not both parts but only one or other, one as the ventrally
situated shell of Nautilus, the other as the dorsally placed shell
for example of Sepia or of Spirula.</p>

<p>In the case of the bivalve shells of the Lamellibranchs or of
the Brachiopods, we have to deal with a phenomenon precisely
analogous to the split and flattened cone of our Pteropods, save
only that the primitive cone has been split into two portions, not
incompletely as in the Pteropod (Hyalaea), but completely, so
as to form two separate valves. Though somewhat greater
freedom is given to growth now that the two valves are separate
and hinged, yet still the two valves oppose and hamper one
another, so that in the longitudinal direction each is capable of
only a moderate curvature. This curvature, as we have seen, is
recognisable as a logarithmic spiral, but only now and then does
the growth of the spiral continue so far as to develop successive
coils: as it does in a few symmetrical forms such as <i>Isocardia cor</i>;
and as it does still more conspicuously in a few others, such as
Gryphaea and Caprinella, where one of the two valves is stunted,
and the growth of the other is (relatively speaking) unopposed.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3><i>Of Septa.</i></h3></div>

<p>Before we leave the subject of the molluscan shell, we have
still another problem to deal with, in regard to the form and
arrangement of the septa which divide up the tubular shell into
chambers, in the Nautilus, the Ammonite and their allies (Fig.
<a href="#fig304" title="go to Fig. 304">304</a>, etc.).</p>

<p>The existence of septa in a Nautiloid shell may probably be
accounted for as follows. We have seen that it is a property of
a cone that, while growing by increments at one end only, it
conserves its original shape: therefore the animal within, which
(though growing by a different law) also conserves its shape, will
continue to fill the shell if it actually fills it to begin with: as
does a snail or other Gastropod. But suppose that our mollusc
fills a part only of a conical shell (as it does in the case of Nautilus);
then, unless it alter its shape, it must move upward as it grows in
the growing cone, until it come to occupy a space
similar in form <span class="xxpn" id="p578">{578}</span>
to that which it occupied before: just, indeed, as a little ball
drops far down into the cone, but a big one must stay farther up.
Then, when the animal after a period of growth has moved farther
up in the shell, the mantle-surface continues its normal secretory
activity, and that portion which had been in contact with the
former septum secretes a septum anew. In short, at any given
epoch, the creature is not secreting a tube and a septum by
separate operations, but is secreting a shelly case about its rounded
body, of which case one part appears to us as the continuation
of the tube, and the other part, merging with it by in­dis­tin­guish­able
boundaries, appears to us as the septum<a class="afnanch" href="#fn532" id="fnanch532">532</a>.</p>

<p>The various forms assumed by the septa in spiral shells<a class="afnanch" href="#fn533" id="fnanch533">533</a>
present us with a number of problems of great beauty, simple in
their essence, but whose full in­ves­ti­ga­tion would soon lead us
into mathematics of a very high order.</p>

<p>We do not know in great detail how these septa are laid down;
but the essential facts are clear<a class="afnanch" href="#fn534" id="fnanch534">534</a>.
The septum begins as a very
thin cuticular membrane (composed apparently of a substance
called conchyolin), which is secreted by the skin, or mantle-surface,
of the animal; and upon this membrane nacreous matter
is gradually laid down on the mantle-side (that is to say between
the animal’s body and the cuticular membrane which has been
thrown off from it), so that the membrane remains as a thin pellicle
over the <i>hinder</i> surface of the septum, and so that, to begin with,
the membranous septum is moulded on the flexible and elastic
surface of the animal, within which the fluids of the body must
exercise a uniform, or nearly uniform pressure.</p>

<div class="dmaths">
<p>Let us think, then, of the septa as they would appear
in their uncalcified condition, formed of, or at least
superposed upon, an <span class="xxpn" id="p579">{579}</span>
elastic membrane. They must then follow the general law,
applicable to all elastic membranes under uniform pressure, that
the tension varies inversely as the radius of curvature; and we
come back once more to our old equation of Laplace, that</p>

<div><i>P</i>
=&#x202f;<i>T</i>(1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>r</i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>r&#xfeff;′</i>).
</div></div><!--dmaths-->

<div class="dright dwth-g" id="fig302">
<img src="images/i579a.png" width="240" height="437" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 302.</div></div>

<p>Moreover, since the cavity below the septum is
practically closed, and is filled either with air or with
water, <i>P</i> will be constant over the whole area of the
septum. And further, we must assume, at least to begin
with, that the membrane constituting the incipient septum
is homogeneous or isotropic.</p>

<p>Let us take first the case of a straight cone, of
circular section, more or less like an Orthoceras; and
let us suppose that the septum is attached to the shell
in a plane perpendicular to its axis. The septum itself
must then obviously be spherical. Moreover the extent of
the spherical surface is constant, and easily determined.
For obviously, in Fig. <a href="#fig302" title="go to
Fig. 302">302</a>, the angle <i>LCL&#xfeff;′</i> equals the supplement
of the angle (<i>LOL&#xfeff;′</i>) of the cone; that is to say, the
circle of contact subtends an angle at the centre of the
spherical surface, which is constant, and which is equal to
π&#x202f;−&#x202f;2θ. The case is not excluded where, owing
to an asymmetry of tensions, the septum meets the side
walls of the cone at other than a right angle,
<br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<div class="dright dwth-h" id="fig303">
<img src="images/i579b.png" width="208" height="379" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 303.</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">as in Fig. <a href="#fig303" title="go
to Fig. 303">303</a>; and here, while the septa still
remain portions of spheres, the geometrical construction
for the position of their centres is equally easy.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, the attachment of the
septum to the inner walls of the cone be in a
plane oblique to the axis, then it is evident that
the outline of the septum will be an ellipse, and
its surface an <span class="xxpn" id="p580">{580}</span>
ellipsoid. If the attachment of the septum be not in one
plane, but form a sinuous line of contact with the cone, then
the septum will be a saddle-shaped surface, of great complexity
and beauty. In all cases, provided only that the membrane be
isotropic, the form assumed will be precisely that of a soap-bubble
under similar conditions of attachment: that is to say, it will be
(with the usual limitations or conditions) a surface of minimal
area.</p>

<div class="dmaths">
<p>If our cone be no longer straight, but curved, then the septa
will be symmetrically deformed in consequence. A beautiful and
interesting case is afforded us by Nautilus itself. Here the
outline of the septum, referred to a plane, is ap­prox­i­mate­ly
bounded by two elliptic curves, similar and similarly situated,
whose areas are to one another in a definite ratio, namely as
<br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<div><i>A</i>&#xfeff;<sub>1</sub>&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>A</i>&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub>
=&#x202f;(<i>r</i>&#xfeff;<sub>1</sub>&#x200a;<i>r&#xfeff;′</i>&#xfeff;<sub>1</sub>)&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;(<i>r</i>&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub>&#x200a;<i>r&#xfeff;′</i>&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub>)
=&#x202f;ε&#xfeff;<sup>−4π&#x202f;cot&#x202f;α</sup>&#x202f;,</div>

<p class="pcontinue">and a similar ratio exists in Ammonites
and all other close-whorled spirals, in which however we
cannot always make the simple assumption of elliptical form.
In a median section of Nautilus, we see each septum forming a
tangent to the inner and to the outer wall, just as it did in a
section of the straight Orthoceras; but the curvatures in the
neighbourhood of these two points of contact are not identical,
for they now vary inversely as the radii, drawn from the pole
of the spiral shell. The contour of the septum in this median
plane is a spiral curve identical with the original logarithmic
spiral. Of this it is the “invert,” and the fact that the
original curve and its invert are both identical is one of
the most beautiful properties of the logarithmic spiral&#xfeff;<a
class="afnanch" href="#fn535" id="fnanch535">535</a>.</p>
</div><!--dmaths-->

<p>But while the outline of the septum in median section is simple
and easy to determine, the curved surface of the septum in its
entirety is a very complicated matter, even in Nautilus which is
one of the simplest of actual cases. For, in the first place, since
the form of the septum, as seen in median section, is that of a
logarithmic spiral, and as therefore its curvature is constantly
altering, it follows that, in successive
<i>transverse</i> sections, the <span class="xxpn" id="p581">{581}</span>
curvature is also constantly altering. But in the case of Nautilus,
there are other aspects of the phenomenon, which we can illustrate,
but only in part, in the following simple manner. Let us imagine</p>

 <div class="pcaption">Fig. 304. Section of <i>Nautilus</i>, shewing

<p class="pcontinue">
a pack of cards, in which we have cut out of each card a similar
concave arc of a logarithmic spiral, such as we actually see in the
median section of the septum of a Nautilus. Then, while we hold
the cards together, foursquare, in the ordinary
position of the <span class="xxpn" id="p582">{582}</span>
pack, we have a simple “ruled” surface, which in any longitudinal
section has the form of a logarithmic spiral but in any transverse
section is a straight horizontal line. If we shear or slide the
cards upon one another, thrusting the middle cards of the pack
forward in advance of the others, till the one end of the pack is
a convex, and the other a concave, ellipse, the cut edges which
combine to represent our septum will now form a curved surface</p>

<p class="pcontinue">of much greater complexity; and this
is part, but not by any means all, of the deformation
produced as a direct consequence of the form in Nautilus
of the section of the tube within which the septum has
to lie. And the complex curvature of the surface will
be manifested in a sinuous outline of the edge, or line
of attachment of the septum to the tube, and will vary
according to the configuration of the latter. In the
case of Nautilus, it is easy to shew empirically (though
not perhaps easy to demonstrate <span class="xxpn"
id="p583">{583}</span> math­e­mat­i­cally) that the sinuous or
saddle-shaped form of the “suture” (or line of attachment
of the septum to the tube) is such as can be precisely
accounted for in this manner. It is also easy to see that,
when the section of the tube (or “generating curve”) is
more complicated in form, when it is flattened, grooved,
or otherwise ornamented, the curvature of the septum
and the outline of its sutural attachment will become
very complicated indeed<a class="afnanch" href="#fn536"
id="fnanch536">536</a>; but it will be comparatively simple
in the case of the first few sutures of the young shell,
laid down before any overlapping of whorls has taken place,
and this comparative simplicity of the first-formed sutures
is a marked feature among Ammonites<a class="afnanch"
href="#fn537" id="fnanch537">537</a>.</p>

<p>We have other sources of complication, besides those which
are at once introduced by the sectional form of the tube. For
instance, the siphuncle, or little inner tube which perforates the
septa, exercises a certain amount of tension, sometimes evidently
considerable, upon the latter; so that we can no longer consider
each septum as an isotropic surface, under uniform pressure; and
there may be other structural modifications, or inequalities, in
that portion of the animal’s body with which the septum is in
contact, and by which it is conformed. It is hardly likely, for
all these reasons, that we shall ever attain to a full and particular
explanation of the septal surfaces and their sutural outlines
throughout the whole range of Cephalopod shells; but in general
terms, the problem is probably not beyond the reach of math­e­mat­i­cal
analysis. The problem might be approached experimentally,
after the manner of Plateau’s experiments,
by bending <span class="xxpn" id="p584">{584}</span>
a wire into the complicated form of the suture-line, and studying
the form of the liquid film which constitutes the cor­re­spon­ding
surface <i>minimae areae</i>.</p>

 Döderlein.)</div></div>

<p>In certain Ammonites the septal outline is further complicated
in another way. Superposed upon the usual sinuous outline, with
its “lobes” and “saddles,” we have here a minutely ramified, or
arborescent outline,</p>

<p class="pcontinue">
in which all the branches terminate in wavy,
more or less circular arcs,—looking just like the ‘landscape
marble’ from the Bristol Rhaetic. We have no difficulty in
recognising in this a surface-tension phenomenon. The figures
are precisely such as we can imitate (for instance)
by pouring a <span class="xxpn" id="p585">{585}</span>
few drops of milk upon a greasy plate, or of oil upon an alkaline
solution.</p>

<p>We have very far from exhausted, we have perhaps little
more than begun, the study of the logarithmic spiral and the
associated curves which find exemplification in the multitudinous
diversities of molluscan shells. But, with a closing word or two,
we must now bring this chapter to an end.</p>

<p>In the spiral shell we have a problem, or a phenomenon, of
growth, immensely simplified by the fact that each successive
increment is irrevocably fixed in regard to magnitude and position,
instead, of remaining in a state of flux and sharing in the further
changes which the organism undergoes. In such a structure, then,
we have certain primary phenomena of growth manifested in their
original simplicity, undisturbed by secondary and conflicting
phenomena. What actually <i>grows</i> is merely the lip of an orifice,
where there is produced a ring of solid material, whose form we
have treated of under the name of the generating curve; and
this generating curve grows in magnitude without alteration of
its form. Besides its increase in areal magnitude, the growing
curve has certain strictly limited degrees of freedom, which define
its motions in space: that is to say, it has a vector motion at
right angles to the axis of the shell; and it has a sliding motion
along that axis. And, though we may know nothing whatsoever
about the actual velocities of any of these motions, we do know
that they are so correlated together that their <i>relative</i> velocities
remain constant, and accordingly the form and symmetry of the
whole system remain in general unchanged.</p>

<p>But there is a vast range of possibilities in regard to every
one of these factors: the generating curve may be of various
forms, and even when of simple form, such as an ellipse, its axes
may be set at various angles to the system; the plane also in
which it lies may vary, almost indefinitely, in its angle relatively
to that of any plane of reference in the system; and in the several
velocities of growth, of rotation and of translation, and therefore
in the ratios between all these, we have again a vast range of
possibilities. We have then a certain definite type, or group of
forms, math­e­mat­i­cally isomorphous, but presenting infinite diversities
of outward appearance: which
diversities, as Swammerdam <span class="xxpn" id="p586">{586}</span>
said, <i>ex sola nascuntur diversitate gyrationum</i>; and which accordingly
are seen to have their origin in differences of rate, or of
magnitude, and so to be, essentially, neither more nor less than
<i>differences of degree</i>.</p>

<p>In nature, we find these forms presenting themselves with
but little relation to the character of the creature by which they
are produced. Spiral forms of certain particular kinds are common
to Gastropods and to Cephalopods, and to diverse families of
each; while outside the class of molluscs altogether, among the
Foraminifera and among the worms (as in Spirorbis, Spirographis,
and in the Dentalium-like shell of Ditrupa), we again meet with
similar and cor­re­spon­ding forms.</p>

<p>Again, we find the same forms, or forms which (save for external
ornament) are math­e­mat­i­cally identical, repeating themselves in
all periods of the world’s geological history; and, irrespective of
climate or local conditions, we see them mixed up, one with
another, in the depths and on the shores of every sea. It is hard
indeed (to my mind) to see where Natural Selection necessarily
enters in, or to admit that it has had any share whatsoever in the
production of these varied conformations. Unless indeed we use
the term Natural Selection in a sense so wide as to deprive it of
any purely biological significance; and so recognise as a sort of
natural selection whatsoever nexus of causes suffices to differentiate
between the likely and the unlikely, the scarce and the
frequent, the easy and the hard: and leads accordingly, under
the peculiar conditions, limitations and restraints which we call
“ordinary circumstances,” one type of crystal, one form of cloud,
one chemical compound, to be of frequent occurrence and another
to be rare.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="p587">
<h2 class="h2herein"
title="XII. The Spiral Shells of the Foraminifera.">CHAPTER
XII <span class="h2ttl"> THE SPIRAL SHELLS OF THE
FORAMINIFERA</span></h2></div>

<p>We have already dealt in a few simple cases with the shells of
the Foraminifera<a class="afnanch" href="#fn538" id="fnanch538">538</a>;
and we have seen that wherever the shell is
but a single unit or single chamber, its form may be explained
in general by the laws of surface tension: the assumption being
that the little mass of protoplasm which makes the simple shell
behaves as a <i>fluid drop</i>, the form of which is perpetuated when
the protoplasm acquires its solid covering. Thus the spherical
Orbulinae and the flask-shaped Lagenae represent drops in
equi­lib­rium, under various conditions of freedom or constraint;
while the irregular, amoeboid body of Astrorhiza is a manifestation
not of equi­lib­rium, but of a varying and fluctuating distribution
of surface energy. When the foraminiferal shell becomes multilocular,
the same general principles continue to hold; the growing
protoplasm increases drop by drop, and each successive drop has
its particular phenomena of surface energy, manifested at its fluid
surface, and tending to confer upon it a certain place in the system
and a certain shape of its own.</p>

<p>It is char­ac­ter­is­tic and even diagnostic of this particular
group of Protozoa (1) that development proceeds by a well-marked
alternation of rest and of activity—of activity during which the
protoplasm increases, and of rest during which the shell is formed;
(2) that the shell is formed at the outer surface of the protoplasmic
organism, and tends to constitute a continuous or all but continuous
covering; and it follows (3) from these two factors taken together
that each successive increment is added on outside of and distinct
from its predecessors, that the successive
parts or chambers of <span class="xxpn" id="p588">{588}</span>
the shell are of different and successive ages, that one part of the
shell is always relatively new, and the rest old in various grades
of seniority.</p>

<p>The forms which we set together in the sister-group of Radiolaria
are very differently characterised. Here the cells or vesicles
of which each little composite organism is made up are but little
separated, and in no way walled off, from one another; the hard
skeletal matter tends to be deposited in the form of isolated
spicules or of little connected rods or plates, at the angles, the
edges or the interfaces of the vesicles; the cells or vesicles form
a coordinated and cotemporaneous rather than a successive series.
In a word, the whole quasi-fluid protoplasmic body may be
likened to a little mass of froth or foam: that is to say, to an
aggregation of simultaneously formed drops or bubbles, whose
physical properties and geometrical relations are very different
from those of a system of drops or bubbles which are formed one
after another, each solidifying before the next is formed.</p>

<div class="dctr01" id="fig308">
<img src="images/i588.png" width="800" height="387" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 308. <i>Hastigerina</i> sp.;
 to shew the “mouth.”</div></div>

<p>With the actual origin or mode of development of the foraminiferal
shell we are now but little concerned. The main factor
is the adsorption, and subsequent precipitation at the surface of
the organism, of calcium carbonate,—the shell so formed being
interrupted by pores or by some larger interspace or “mouth”
(Fig. <a href="#fig308" title="go to Fig. 308">308</a>), which interruptions we may doubtless interpret as
being due to unequal distributions of surface
energy. In many <span class="xxpn" id="p589">{589}</span>
cases the fluid protoplasm “picks up” sand-grains and other
foreign particles, after a fashion which we have already described
(p. <a href="#p463" title="go to pg. 463">463</a>); and it cements these together with more or less of
calcareous material. The calcareous shell is a crystalline structure,
and the micro-crystals of calcium carbonate are so set that their
little prisms radiate outwards in each chamber through the thickness
of the wall:—which symmetry is subject to cor­re­spon­ding
modification when the spherical chambers are more or less symmetrically
deformed<a class="afnanch" href="#fn539" id="fnanch539">539</a>.</p>

<p>In various ways the rounded, drop-like shells of the Foraminifera,
both simple and compound, have been artificially
imitated. Thus, if small globules of mercury be immersed in
water in which a little chromic acid is allowed to dissolve, as the
little beads of quicksilver become slowly covered with a crystalline
coat of mercuric chromate they assume various forms reminiscent
of the monothalamic Foraminifera. The mercuric chromate has
a higher atomic volume than the mercury which it replaces, and
therefore the fluid contents of the drop are under pressure, which
increases with the thickness of the pellicle; hence at some weak
spot in the latter the contents will presently burst forth, so forming
a mouth to the little shell. Sometimes a long thread is formed,
just as in <i>Rhabdammina linearis</i>; and sometimes unduloid
swellings make their appearance on such a thread, just as in
<i>R. discreta</i>. And again, by appropriate modifications of the
experimental conditions, it is possible (as Rhumbler has shewn)
to build up a chambered shell<a class="afnanch" href="#fn540" id="fnanch540">540</a>.</p>

<p>In a few forms, such as Globigerina and its close allies, the
shell is beset during life with excessively long and delicate
calcareous spines or needles. It is only in oceanic forms that
these are present, because only when poised
in water can such <span class="xxpn" id="p590">{590}</span>
delicate structures endure; in dead shells, such as we are much
more familiar with, every trace of them is broken and rubbed
away. The growth of these long needles is explained (as we have
already briefly mentioned, on p. <a href="#p440" title="go to pg. 440">440</a>) by the phenomenon which
Lehmann calls <i>orientirte Adsorption</i>—the tendency for a crystalline
structure to grow by accretion, not necessarily in the outward form
of a “crystal,” but continuing in any direction or orientation
which has once been impressed upon it: in this case the spicular
growth is simply in direct continuation of the radial symmetry
of the micro-crystalline elements of the shell-wall. Over the
surface of the shell the radiating spicules tend to occur in a
hexagonal pattern, symmetrically grouped around the pores which
perforate the shell. Rhumbler has suggested that this arrangement
is due to diffusion-currents, forming little eddies about the
base of the pseudopodia issuing from the pores: the idea being
borrowed from Bénard, to whom is due the discovery of this type
or order of vortices<a class="afnanch" href="#fn541" id="fnanch541">541</a>.
In one of Bénard’s experiments a thin
layer of paraffin is strewn with particles of graphite, then warmed
to melting, whereupon each little solid granule becomes the centre
of a vortex; by the interaction of these vortices the particles tend
to be repelled to equal distances from one another, and in the
end they are found to be arranged in a hexagonal pattern<a class="afnanch" href="#fn542" id="fnanch542">542</a>.
The
analogy is plain between this experiment and those diffusion
experiments by which Leduc produces his beautiful hexagonal
systems of artificial cells, with which we have dealt in a previous
chapter (p. <a href="#p320" title="go to pg. 320">320</a>).</p>

<p>But let us come back to the shell itself, and consider particularly
its spiral form. That the shell in the Foraminifera should
tend towards a spiral form need not surprise us; for we have
learned that one of the fundamental conditions of the production
of a concrete spiral is just precisely what we have here, namely
the gradual development of a structure by means of successive
increments superadded to its exterior, which then form part,
successively, of a permanent and rigid
structure. This condition <span class="xxpn" id="p591">{591}</span>
is obviously forthcoming in the foraminiferal, but not at all in
the radiolarian, shell. Our second fundamental condition of the
production of a logarithmic spiral is that each successive increment
shall be so posited and so conformed that its addition to the
system leaves the form of the whole system unchanged. We
have now to enquire into this latter condition; and to determine
whether the successive increments, or successive chambers, of the
foraminiferal shell actually constitute <i>gnomons</i> to the entire
structure.</p>

<p>It is obvious enough that the spiral shells of the Foraminifera
closely resemble true logarithmic spirals. Indeed so precisely do
the minute shells of many Foraminifera repeat or simulate the
spiral shells of Nautilus and its allies that to the naturalists of the
early nineteenth century they were known as the <i>Céphalopodes
microscopiques</i><a class="afnanch" href="#fn543" id="fnanch543">543</a>,
until Dujardin shewed that their little bodies
comprised no complex anatomy of organs, but consisted merely
of that slime-like organic matter which he taught us to call
“sarcode,” and which we learned afterwards from Schwann to
speak of as “protoplasm.”</p>

<div class="dctr03" id="fig309">
<img src="images/i591.png" width="604" height="388" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 309. <i>Nummulina antiquior</i>, R. and V.
(After V. von Möller.)</div></div>

<p>One striking difference, however, is apparent between the
shell of Nautilus and the little nautiloid or rotaline
shells of the Foraminifera: namely that the septa in these
latter, and in all other <span class="xxpn" id="p592">{592}</span>
chambered Foraminifera, are convex outwards (Fig. <a href="#fig308" title="go to Fig. 308">308</a>), whereas
they are concave outwards in Nautilus (Fig. <a href="#fig304" title="go to Fig. 304">304</a>) and in the rest
of the chambered molluscan shells. The reason is perfectly
simple. In both cases the curvature of the septum was determined
before it became rigid, and at a time when it had the
properties either of a fluid film or an elastic membrane. In both
cases the actual curvature is determined by the tensions of the
membrane and the pressures to which it was exposed. Now it
is obvious that the extrinsic pressure which the tension of the
membrane has to withstand is on opposite sides in the two cases.
In Nautilus, the pressure to be resisted is that produced by the
growing body of the animal, lying to the <i>outer side</i> of the septum,
in the outer, wider portion of the tubular shell. In the Foraminifer
the septum at the time of its formation was no septum at all;
it was but a portion of the convex surface of a drop-that portion
namely which afterwards became overlapped and enclosed by the
succeeding drop; and the curvature of the septum is concave
towards the pressure to be resisted, which latter is <i>inside</i> the
septum, being simply the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid contents
of the drop. The one septum is, speaking generally, the reverse
of the other; the organism, so to speak, is outside the one and
inside the other; and in both cases alike, the septum tends to
assume the form of a surface of minimal area, as permitted, or as
defined, by all the circumstances of the case.</p>

<p>The logarithmic spiral is easily recognisable in typical cases<a class="afnanch" href="#fn544" id="fnanch544">544</a>
(and especially where the spire makes more than one visible
revolution about the pole), by its fundamental property of continued
similarity: that is to say, by reason of the fact that the
big many-chambered shell is of just the same shape as the smaller
and younger shell—which phenomenon is apparent and even
obvious in the nautiloid Foraminifera, as in Nautilus itself: but
nevertheless the nature of the curve must be verified by careful
measurement, just as Moseley determined
or verified it in his <span class="xxpn" id="p593">{593}</span>
original study of nautilus (cf. p. <a href="#p518" title="go to pg. 518">518</a>). This has accordingly been
done, by various writers: and in the first instance by Valerian
von Möller, in an elaborate study of Fusulina—a palaeozoic genus
whose little shells have built up vast tracts of carboniferous
limestone over great part of European Russia<a class="afnanch" href="#fn545" id="fnanch545">545</a>.</p>

<p>In this genus a growing surface of protoplasm may be conceived
as wrapping round and round a small initial chamber, in
such a way as to produce a fusiform or ellipsoidal shell—a transverse
section of which reveals the close-wound spiral coil. The
following are examples of measurements of the successive whorls
in a couple of species of this genus.</p>

<p>In Fusulina, and in some few other Foraminifera (cf. Fig.

the spire seems to wind evenly on, with little or no
external sign of the successive periods of growth, or successive
chambers of the shell. The septa which mark off the chambers,
and correspond to retardations or cessations in the periodicity of
growth, are still to be found in sections of the shell of Fusulina;
but they are somewhat irregular and comparatively inconspicuous;
the measurements we have just spoken of are taken without
reference to the segments or chambers, but only with reference
to the whorls, or in other words with direct reference to the

number of cases. Van Iterson<a class="afnanch" href="#fn547"
id="fnanch547">547</a> has done so in various Miliolinidae,
with such results as the following:</p>

<p>Here the mean ratio of breadth of consecutive chambers may
be taken as 1·323 (that is to say, the eighth root of 319&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;34); and
the calculated values, as given above, are based on this determination.</p>

<p>Again, Rhumbler has measured the linear dimensions of a
number of rotaline forms, for instance <i>Pulvinulina menardi</i>
(Fig. <a href="#fig259" title="go to Fig. 259">259</a>): in which common species he finds the mean linear
ratio of consecutive chambers to be about 1·187. In both cases,
and especially in the latter, the ratio is not strictly constant from
chamber to chamber, but is subject to a small secondary fluctuation<a class="afnanch" href="#fn548" id="fnanch548">548</a>.</p>

<p>When the linear dimensions of successive chambers are in
continued proportion, then, in order that the whole shell may
constitute a logarithmic spiral, it is necessary that the several
chambers should subtend equal angles of revolution at the pole.
In the case of the Miliolidae this is obviously the case (Fig. <a href="#fig311" title="go to Fig. 311">311</a>);
for in this family the chambers lie in two rows (Biloculina), or
three rows (Triloculina), or in some other small number of series:
so that the angles subtended by them are large, simple fractions
of the circular arc, such as 180° or 120°. In many of the nautiloid
forms, such as Cyclammina (Fig. <a href="#fig312" title="go to Fig. 312">312</a>), the angles</p>

may see by Fig. <a href="#fig313" title="go to Fig. 313">313</a>; where the angle subtended by each chamber
is made equal to 20°, and this diagrammatic figure is not perceptibly
different from the other. In some cases the subtended
angle is less constant; and in these it would be necessary to equate
the several linear dimensions with the cor­re­spon­ding vector angles,
according to our equation <i>r</i>
=&#x202f;<i>e</i>&#xfeff;<sup>θ&#x202f;cot&#x202f;α</sup>&#x202f;. It is probable that, by so
taking account of variations of θ, such variations of <i>r</i> as (according
to Rhumbler’s measurements) Pulvinulina and other genera
appear to shew, would be found to diminish or even to disappear.</p>

<p>The law of increase by which each chamber bears a constant
ratio of magnitude to the next may be looked upon as
a simple consequence of the structural uniformity or
homogeneity of the organism; we have merely to suppose
(as this uniformity would naturally lead us to do) that
the rate of increase is at each instant proportional to
the whole existing mass. For if <i>V</i>&#xfeff;<sub>0</sub>&#x202f;, <i>V</i>&#xfeff;<sub>1</sub> etc.,

<p>This ratio of 1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;(1&#x202f;+&#x202f;<i>q</i>) is easily shewn to be the constant ratio
running through the whole series, from chamber to chamber;
and if this ratio of volumes be constant, so also are the ratios
of cor­re­spon­ding surfaces, and of cor­re­spon­ding linear dimensions,
provided always that the successive increments, or successive
chambers, are similar in form.</p>

<p>We have still to discuss the similarity of form and the symmetry
of position which characterise the successive chambers, and which,
together with the law of continued proportionality of size, are the
distinctive characters and the indispensable conditions of a series
of “gnomons.”</p>

<div class="dctr05" id="fig314">

 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 314. <i>Orbulina
 universa</i>, d’Orb.</div></div>

<p>The minute size of the foraminiferal shell or at least of each
successive increment thereof, taken in connection with the fluid
or semi-fluid nature of the protoplasmic substance, is enough to
suggest that the molecular forces, and especially the force of
surface-tension, must exercise a controlling influence over the form
of the whole structure; and this suggestion, or belief, is already
implied in our statement that each successive increment of growing
protoplasm constitutes a separate <i>drop</i>. These “drops,” partially
concealed by their successors, but still shewing in part their
rounded outlines, are easily recognisable in the various foraminiferal
shells which are illustrated in this chapter.</p>

<p>The accompanying figure represents, to begin with, the spherical
shell char­ac­ter­is­tic of the common, floating, oceanic Orbulina.
In the specimen illustrated, a second chamber,
superadded to the <span class="xxpn" id="p599">{599}</span>
first, has arisen as a drop of protoplasm which exuded through the
pores of the first chamber, accumulated on its surface, and spread
over the latter till it came to rest in a position of equi­lib­rium.
We may take it that this position of equi­lib­rium is determined,
at least in the first instance, by the “law of the constant angle,”
which holds, or tends to hold, in all cases where the free surface
of a given liquid is in contact with a given solid, in presence of
another liquid or a gas. The cor­re­spon­ding equations are precisely
the same as those which we have used in discussing the
form of a drop (on p. <a href="#p294" title="go to pg. 294">294</a>); though some slight modification must
be made in our definitions, inasmuch as the consideration of
surface-<i>tension</i> is no longer appropriate at the solid surfaces, and
the concept of surface-<i>energy</i> must take its place. Be that as it
may, it is enough for us to observe that, in such a case as ours,
when a given fluid (namely protoplasm) is in surface contact with
a solid (viz. a calcareous shell), in presence of another fluid (sea-water),
then the angle of contact, or angle by which the common
surface (or interface) of the two liquids abuts against the solid wall,
tends to be constant: and that being so, the drop will have a
certain definite form, depending (<i>inter alia</i>) on the form of the
surface with which it is in contact. After a period of rest, during
which the surface of our second drop becomes rigid by calcification,
a new period of growth will recur and a new drop of protoplasm
be accumulated. Circumstances remaining the same, this new
drop will meet the solid surface of the shell at the same angle as
did the former one; and, the other forces at work on the system
remaining the same, the form of the whole drop, or chamber, will
be the same as before.</p>

<p>According to Rhumbler, this “law of the constant angle” is
the fundamental principle in the mechanical conformation of the
foraminiferal shell, and provides for the symmetry of form as
well as of position in each succeeding drop of protoplasm: which
form and position, once acquired, become rigid and fixed with the
onset of calcification. But Rhumbler’s explanation brings with
it its own difficulties. It is by no means easy of verification, for
on the very complicated curved surfaces of the shell it seems to
me extraordinarily difficult to measure, or even to recognise, the
actual angle of contact: of which angle of contact,
by the way, <span class="xxpn" id="p600">{600}</span>
but little is known, save only in the particular case where one of
the three bodies is air, as when a surface of water is exposed to
air and in contact with glass. It is easy moreover to see that in
many of our Foraminifera the angle of contact, though it may be
constant in homologous positions from chamber to chamber, is
by no means constant at all points along the boundary of each
chamber. In Cristellaria, for instance (Fig. <a href="#fig315" title="go to Fig. 315">315</a>), it would seem
to be (and Rhumbler</p>

<div class="dctr06" id="fig315">

<p class="pcontinue">asserts that it actually is) about 90° on the
outer side and only about 50° on the inner side of each septal
partition; in Pulvinulina (Fig. <a href="#fig259" title="go to Fig. 259">259</a>), according to Rhumbler, the
angles adjacent to the mouth are of 90°, and the opposite angles
are of 60°, in each chamber. For these and other similar discrepancies
Rhumbler would account by simply invoking the heterogeneity
of the protoplasmic drop: that is to say, by assuming that
the protoplasm has a different composition and different properties
(including a very different distribution of surface-energy), at
points near to and remote from the mouth of the shell. Whether
the differences in angle of contact be as great as Rhumbler takes
them to be, whether marked heterogeneities of the protoplasm
occur, and whether these be enough to account for the differences
of angle, I cannot tell. But it seems to me that we had better
rest content with a general statement, and that Rhumbler has
taken too precise and narrow a view.
<span class="xxpn" id="p601">{601}</span></p>

<p>In the molecular growth of a crystal, although we must of
necessity assume that each molecule settles down in a position of
minimum potential energy, we find it very hard indeed to explain
precisely, even in simple cases and after all the labours of modern
crystallographers, why this or that position is actually a place of
minimum potential. In the case of our little Foraminifer (just
as in the case of the crystal), let us then be content to assert that
each drop or bead of protoplasm takes up a position of minimum
potential energy, in relation to all the circumstances of the case;
and let us not attempt, in the present state of our knowledge, to
define that position of minimum potential by reference to angle
of contact or any other particular condition of equi­lib­rium. In
most cases the whole exposed surface, on some portion of which
the drop must come to rest, is an extremely complicated one, and
the forces involved constitute a system which, in its entirety, is
more complicated still; but from the symmetry of the case and
the continuity of the whole phenomenon, we are entitled to believe
that the conditions are just the same, or very nearly the same,
time after time, from one chamber to another: as the one chamber
is conformed so will the next tend to be, and as the one is situated
relatively to the system so will its successor tend to be situated in
turn. The physical law of minimum potential (including also the
law of minimal area) is all that we need in order to explain, <i>in
general terms</i>, the continued similarity of one chamber to another;
and the physiological law of growth, by which a continued proportionality
of size tends to run through the series of successive
chambers, impresses upon this series of similar increments the
form of a logarithmic spiral.</p>

<p>In each particular case the nature of the logarithmic spiral,
as defined by its constant angle, will be chiefly determined by
the rate of growth; that is to say by the particular ratio in which
each new chamber exceeds its predecessor in magnitude. But
shells having the same constant angle (α) may still differ from one
another in many ways—in the general form and relative position
of the chambers, in their extent of overlap, and hence in the actual
contour and appearance of the shell; and these variations must
correspond to particular distributions of energy within the system,
which is governed as a whole by the law
of minimum potential. <span class="xxpn" id="p602">{602}</span></p>

<p>Our problem, then, becomes reduced to that of investigating
the possible con­fi­gur­a­tions which may be derived from the successive
symmetrical apposition of similar bodies whose magnitudes
are in continued proportion; and it is obvious, math­e­mat­i­cally
speaking, that the various possible arrangements all come under
the head of the logarithmic spiral, together with the limiting cases
which it includes. Since the difference between one such form
and another depends upon the numerical value of certain
coefficients of magnitude, it is plain that any one must tend to
pass into any other by small and continuous gradations; in
other words, that a <i>clas­si­fi­ca­tion</i> of these forms must (like any
clas­si­fi­ca­tion whatsoever of logarithmic spirals or of any other
math­e­mat­i­cal curves), be theoretic or “artificial.” But we may
easily make such an artificial clas­si­fi­ca­tion, and shall probably
find it to agree, more or less, with the usual methods of clas­si­fi­ca­tion
recognised by biological students of the Foraminifera.</p>

<p>Firstly we have the typically spiral shells, which occur in
great variety, and which (for our present purpose) we need hardly
describe further. We may merely notice how in certain cases,
for instance Globigerina, the individual chambers are little removed
from spheres; in other words, the area of contact between the
adjacent chambers is small. In such forms as Cyclammina and
Pulvinulina, on the other hand, each chamber is greatly overlapped
by its successor, and the spherical form of each is lost in
a marked asymmetry. Furthermore, in Globigerina and some
others we have a tendency to the development of a helicoid spiral
in space, as in so many of our univalve molluscan shells. The
math­e­mat­i­cal problem of how a shell should grow, under the
assumptions which we have made, would probably find its most
general statement in such a case as that of Globigerina, where the
whole organism lives and grows freely poised in a medium whose
density is little different from its own.</p>

<p>The majority of spiral forms, on the other hand, are plane
or discoid spirals, and we may take it that in these cases some
force has exercised a controlling influence, so as to keep all the
chambers in a plane. This is especially the case in forms like
Rotalia or Discorbina (Fig. <a href="#fig316" title="go to Fig. 316">316</a>), where the organism lives attached
to a rock or a frond of sea-weed; for here (just as in
the case of <span class="xxpn" id="p603">{603}</span>
the coiled tubes which little worms such as Serpula and Spirorbis
make, under similar conditions) the spiral disc is itself asymmetrical,
its whorls being markedly flattened on their attached surfaces.</p>

<div class="dctr06" id="fig316">
<img src="images/i603.png" width="400" height="950" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 316. <i>Discorbina
 bertheloti</i>, d’Orb.</div></div>

<p>We may also conceive, among other conditions, the
very curious case in which the protoplasm may entirely
overspread the surface of the shell without reaching a
position of equi­lib­rium; in which case a new shell will
be formed <i>enclosing</i> the old one, <span class="xxpn"
id="p604">{604}</span> whether the old one be in the form
of a single, solitary chamber, or have already attained to
the form of a chambered or spiral shell. This is precisely
what often happens in the case of Orbulina, when within
the spherical shell we find a small, but perfectly formed,
spiral “Globigerina<a class="afnanch" href="#fn549"
id="fnanch549">549</a>.”</p>

<p>The various Miliolidae (Fig. <a href="#fig311" title="go to Fig. 311">311</a>), only differ from the typical
spiral, or rotaline forms, in the large angle subtended by each
chamber, and the consequent abruptness of their inclination to
each other. In these cases the <i>outward</i> appearance of a spiral
tends to be lost; and it behoves us to recollect, all the more,
that our spiral curve is not necessarily identical with the <i>outline</i>
of the shell, but is always a line drawn through cor­re­spon­ding
points in the successive chambers of the latter.</p>

<div class="dctr02" id="fig317">
<img src="images/i604.png" width="705" height="365" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 317. A, <i>Tertularia trochus</i>, d’Orb. B,
<i>T. concava</i>, Karrer.</div></div>

<p>We reach a limiting case of the logarithmic spiral
when the chambers are arranged in a straight line; and
the eye will tend to associate with this limiting case
the much more numerous forms in which the spiral angle
is small, and the shell only exhibits a gentle curve with
no succession of enveloping whorls. This constitutes the
Nodosarian type (Fig. <a href="#fig87" title="go to Fig. 87">87</a>, p. <a href="#p262" title="go to pg. 262">262</a>); and here again, we must
postulate some force which has tended to keep the chambers
in a rectilinear series: such for instance as gravity,
acting on a system of “hanging drops.” <span class="xxpn"
id="p605">{605}</span></p>

<p>In Textularia and its allies (Fig. <a href="#fig317" title="go to Fig. 317">317</a>), we have a precise
parallel to the helicoid cyme of the botanists (cf. p. <a href="#p502" title="go to pg. 502">502</a>): that
is to say we have a screw translation, perpendicular to the plane
of the underlying logarithmic spiral. In other words, in tracing
a genetic spiral through the whole succession of chambers, we do
so by a continuous vector rotation, through successive angles of
180° (or 120° in some cases), while the pole moves along an axis
perpendicular to the original plane of the spiral.</p>

<p>Another type is furnished by the “cyclic” shells of the
Orbitolitidae, where small and numerous chambers tend to be
added on round and round the system, so building up a circular
flattened disc. This again we perceive to be, math­e­mat­i­cally, a
limiting case of the logarithmic spiral, where the spiral has become
a circle and the constant angle is now an angle of 90°.</p>

<p>Lastly there are a certain number of Foraminifera in which,
without more ado, we may simply say that the arrangement of
the chambers is irregular, neither the law of constant ratio of
magnitude nor that of constant form being obeyed. The chambers
are heaped pell-mell upon one another, and such forms are known
to naturalists as the Acervularidae.</p>

<p>While in these last we have an extreme lack of regularity, we
must not exaggerate the regularity or constancy which the more
ordinary forms display. We may think it hard to believe that
the simple causes, or simple laws, which we have described should
operate, and operate again and again, in millions of individuals to
produce the same delicate and complex conformations. But we
are taking a good deal for granted if we assert that they do so,
and in particular we are assuming, with very little proof, the
“constancy of species” in this group of animals. Just as Verworn
has shewn that the typical <i>Amoeba proteus</i>, when a trace of alkali
is added to the water in which it lives, tends, by alteration of
surface tensions, to protrude the more delicate pseudopodia
char­ac­ter­is­tic of <i>A. radiosa</i>,—and again when the water is rendered
a little more alkaline, to turn apparently into the so-called <i>A.
limax</i>,—so it is evident that a very slight modification in the
surface-energies concerned, might tend to turn one so-called
species into another among the Foraminifera. To what extent
this process actually occurs, we
do not know. <span class="xxpn" id="p606">{606}</span></p>

<p>But that this, or something of the kind, does actually occur
we can scarcely doubt. For example in the genus Peneroplis, the
first portion of the shell consists of a series of chambers arranged
in a spiral or nautiloid series; but as age advances the spiral is
apt to be modified in various ways<a class="afnanch" href="#fn550" id="fnanch550">550</a>.
Sometimes the successive
chambers grow rapidly broader, the whole shell becoming fan-shaped.
Sometimes the chambers become narrower, till they no
longer enfold the earlier chambers but only come in contact each
with its immediate predecessor: the result being that the shell
straightens out, and (taking into account the earlier spiral portion)
may be described as crozier-shaped. Between these extremes of
shape, and in regard to other variations of thickness or thinness,
roughness or smoothness, and so on, there are innumerable
gradations passing one into another and intermixed without regard
to geographical distribution:—“wherever Peneroplides abound
this wide variation exists, and nothing can be more easy than to
pick out a number of striking specimens and give to each a distinctive
name, but <i>in no other way can they be divided into</i>
‘<i>species.</i>’<a class="afnanch" href="#fn551" id="fnanch551">551</a>”
Some writers have wondered at the peculiar
variability of this particular shell<a class="afnanch" href="#fn552" id="fnanch552">552</a>;
but for all we know of the
life-history of the Foraminifera, it may well be that a great
number of the other forms which we distinguish as separate species
and even genera are no more than temporary manifestations of
the same variability<a class="afnanch" href="#fn553" id="fnanch553">553</a>.
<span class="xxpn" id="p607">{607}</span></p>

<div class="section">
<h3><i>Conclusion.</i></h3></div>

<p>If we can comprehend and interpret on some such lines as
these the form and mode of growth of the foraminiferal shell, we
may also begin to understand two striking features of the group,
namely, on the one hand the large number of diverse types or
families which exist and the large number of species and varieties
within each, and on the other the persistence of forms which in
many cases seem to have undergone little change or none at all
from the Cretaceous or even from earlier periods to the present
day. In few other groups, perhaps only among the Radiolaria,
do we seem to possess so nearly complete a picture of all possible
transitions between form and form, and of the whole branching
system of the evolutionary tree: as though little or nothing of it
had ever perished, and the whole web of life, past and present,
were as complete as ever. It leads one to imagine that these
shells have grown according to laws so simple, so much in harmony
with their material, with their environment, and with all the
forces internal and external to which they are exposed, that none
is better than another and none fitter or less fit to survive. It
invites one also to contemplate the possibility of the lines of
possible variation being here so narrow and determinate that
identical forms may have come independently into being again
and again.</p>

<p>While we can trace in the most complete and beautiful manner
the passage of one form into another among these little shells,
and ascribe them all at last (if we please) to a series which starts
with the simple sphere of Orbulina or with the amoeboid body of
Astrorhiza, the question stares us in the face whether this be an
“evolution” which we have any right to correlate with historic
<i>time</i>. The mathematician can trace one conic section into
another, and “evolve” for example, through innumerable graded
ellipses, the circle from the straight line: which tracing of continuous
steps is a true “evolution,” though time has no part
therein. It was after this fashion that Hegel, and for that matter
Aristotle himself, was an evolutionist—to
whom evolution was <span class="xxpn" id="p608">{608}</span>
a mental concept, involving order and continuity in thought, but
not an actual sequence of events in time. Such a conception of
evolution is not easy for the modern biologist to grasp, and harder
still to appreciate. And so it is that even those who, like Dreyer<a class="afnanch" href="#fn554" id="fnanch554">554</a>
and like Rhumbler, study the foraminiferal shell as a physical
system, who recognise that its whole plan and mode of growth is
closely akin to the phenomena exhibited by fluid drops under
particular conditions, and who explain the conformation of the
shell by help of the same physical principles and math­e­mat­i­cal
laws—yet all the while abate no jot or tittle of the ordinary
postulates of modern biology, nor doubt the validity and universal
applicability of the concepts of Darwinian evolution. For these
writers the <i>biogenetisches Grundgesetz</i> remains impregnable. The
Foraminifera remain for them a great family tree, whose actual
pedigree is traceable to the remotest ages; in which historical
evolution has coincided with progressive change; and in which
structural fitness for a particular function (or functions) has
exercised its selective action and ensured “the survival of the
fittest.” By successive stages of historic evolution we are supposed
to pass from the irregular Astrorhiza to a Rhabdammina with its
more concentrated disc; to the forms of the same genus which
consist of but a single tube with central chamber; to those where
this chamber is more and more distinctly segmented; so to the
typical many-chambered Nodosariae; and from these, by another
definite advance and later evolution to the spiral Trochamminae.
After this fashion, throughout the whole varied series of the
Foraminifera, Dreyer and Rhumbler (following Neumayr) recognise
so many successions of related forms, one passing into another,
and standing towards it in a definite relationship of ancestry or
descent. Each evolution of form, from simpler to more complex,
is deemed to have been attended by an advantage to the
organism, an enhancement of its chances of survival or perpetuation;
hence the historically older forms are, on the whole,
structurally the simpler; or conversely the simpler forms, such
as the simple sphere, were the first to come into being in primeval
seas; and finally, the gradual development
and increasing <span class="xxpn" id="p609">{609}</span>
complication of the individual within its own lifetime is held to
be at least a partial recapitulation of the unknown history of
its race and dynasty<a class="afnanch" href="#fn555" id="fnanch555">555</a>.</p>

<p>We encounter many difficulties when we try to extend such
concepts as these to the Foraminifera. We are led for instance
to assert, as Rhumbler does, that the increasing complexity of the
shell, and of the manner in which one chamber is fitted on another,
makes for advantage; and the particular advantage on which
Rhumbler rests his argument is <i>strength</i>. Increase of strength, <i>die
Festigkeitssteigerung</i>, is according to him the guiding principle in
foraminiferal evolution, and marks the historic stages of their
development in geologic time. But in days gone by I used to
see the beach of a little Connemara bay bestrewn with millions
upon millions of foraminiferal shells, simple Lagenae, less simple
Nodosariae, more complex Rotaliae: all drifted by wave and
gentle current from their sea-cradle to their sandy grave: all
lying bleached and dead: one more delicate than another, but all
(or vast multitudes of them) perfect and unbroken. And so I
am not inclined to believe that niceties of form affect the case
very much: nor in general that foraminiferal life involves a
struggle for existence wherein breakage is a constant danger to
be averted, and increased strength an advantage to be ensured<a class="afnanch" href="#fn556" id="fnanch556">556</a>.</p>

<p>In the course of the same argument Rhumbler remarks that
Foraminifera are absent from the coarse sands and gravels<a class="afnanch" href="#fn557" id="fnanch557">557</a>,
as
Williamson indeed had observed many years ago:
so averting, or <span class="xxpn" id="p610">{610}</span>
at least escaping, the dangers of concussion. But this is after
all a very simple matter of mechanical analysis. The coarseness
or fineness of the sediment on the sea-bottom is a measure of the
current: where the current is strong the larger stones are washed
clean, where there is perfect stillness the finest mud settles down;
and the light, fragile shells of the Foraminifera find their appropriate
place, like every other graded sediment, in this spontaneous
order of lixiviation.</p>

<p>The theorem of Organic Evolution is one thing; the problem
of deciphering the lines of evolution, the order of phylogeny, the
degrees of relationship and consanguinity, is quite another. Among
the higher organisms we arrive at conclusions regarding these
things by weighing much circumstantial evidence, by dealing with
the resultant of many variations, and by considering the probability
or improbability of many coincidences of cause and effect; but
even then our conclusions are at best uncertain, our judgments
are continually open to revision and subject to appeal, and all
the proof and confirmation we can ever have is that which comes
from the direct, but fragmentary evidence of palaeontology<a class="afnanch" href="#fn558" id="fnanch558">558</a>.</p>

<p>But in so far as forms can be shewn to depend on the play of
physical forces, and the variations of form to be directly due to
simple quantitative variations in these, just so far are we thrown
back on our guard before the biological conception of consanguinity,
and compelled to revise the vague canons which connect
clas­si­fi­ca­tion with phylogeny.</p>

<p>The physicist explains in terms of the properties of matter,
and classifies according to a math­e­mat­i­cal analysis, all the drops
and forms of drops and associations of drops, all the kinds of
froth and foam, which he may discover among inanimate things;
and his task ends there. But when such forms, such conformations
and con­fi­gur­a­tions, occur among <i>living</i> things, then at once the
biologist introduces his concepts of heredity, of historical evolution,
of succession in time, of recapitulation of remote ancestry in
individual growth, of common origin (unless contradicted by
direct evidence) of similar forms remotely separated by geographic
space or geologic time, of fitness
for a function, of <span class="xxpn" id="p611">{611}</span>
adaptation to an environment, of higher and lower, of “better”
and “worse.” This is the fundamental difference between the
“explanations” of the physicist and those of the biologist.</p>

<p>In the order of physical and math­e­mat­i­cal complexity there is
no question of the sequence of historic time. The forces that
bring about the sphere, the cylinder or the ellipsoid are the same
yesterday and to-morrow. A snow-crystal is the same to-day as
when the first snows fell. The physical forces which mould the
forms of Orbulina, of Astrorhiza, of Lagena or of Nodosaria to-day
were still the same, and for aught we have reason to believe the
physical conditions under which they worked were not appreciably
different, in that yesterday which we call the Cretaceous epoch;
or, for aught we know, throughout all that duration of time which
is marked, but not measured, by the geological record.</p>

<p>In a word, the minuteness of our organism brings its conformation
as a whole within the range of the molecular forces; the
laws of its growth and form appear to lie on simple lines; what
Bergson calls<a class="afnanch" href="#fn559" id="fnanch559">559</a>
the “ideal kinship” is plain and certain, but the
“material affiliation” is problematic and obscure; and, in the
end and upshot, it seems to me by no means certain that the
biologist’s usual mode of reasoning is appropriate to the case, or
that the concept of continuous historical evolution must necessarily,
or may safely and legitimately, be employed.</p>

THE SHAPES OF HORNS, AND OF TEETH OR TUSKS: WITH A NOTE ON
TORSION</span></h2></div>

<p>We have had so much to say on the subject of shell-spirals
that we must deal briefly with the analogous problems which are
presented by the horns of sheep, goats, antelopes and other
horned quadrupeds; and all the more, because these horn-spirals
are on the whole less symmetrical, less easy of measurement than
those of the shell, and in other ways also are less easy of in­ves­ti­ga­tion.
Let us dispense altogether in this case with mathematics;
and be content with a very simple account of the configuration
of a horn.</p>

<p>There are three types of horn which deserve separate consideration:
firstly, the horn of the rhinoceros; secondly the
horns of the sheep, the goat, the ox or the antelope, that is to say,
of the so-called hollow-horned ruminants; and thirdly, the solid
bony horns, or “antlers,” which are char­ac­ter­is­tic of the deer.</p>

<p>The horn of the rhinoceros presents no difficulty. It is
physiologically equivalent to a mass of consolidated hairs, and,
like ordinary hair, it consists of non-living or “formed” material,
continually added to by the living tissues at its base. In section,
that is to say in the form of its “generating curve,” the horn is
ap­prox­i­mate­ly elliptical, with the long axis fore-and-aft, or, in
some species, nearly circular. Its longitudinal growth proceeds
with a maximum velocity anteriorly, and a minimum posteriorly;
and the ratio of these velocities being constant, the horn curves
into the form of a logarithmic spiral in the manner that we have
already studied. The spiral is of small angle, but in the longer-horned
species, such as the great white rhinoceros (Ceratorhinus),
the spiral form is distinctly to be recognised.
As the horn <span class="xxpn" id="p613">{613}</span>
occupies a median position on the head,—a position, that is to say,
of symmetry in respect to the field of force on either side,—there
is no tendency towards a lateral twist, and the horn accordingly
develops as a <i>plane</i> logarithmic spiral. When two horns coexist,
the hinder one is much the smaller of the two: which is as much
as to say that the force, or rate, of growth diminishes as we pass
backwards, just as it does within the limits of the single horn.
And accordingly, while both horns have <i>essentially</i> the same
shape, the spiral curvature is less manifest in the second one,
simply by reason of its comparative shortness.</p>

<p>The paired horns of the ordinary hollow-horned ruminants,
such as the sheep or the goat, grow under conditions which are
in some respects similar, but which differ in other and important
respects from the conditions under which the horn grows in the
rhinoceros. As regards its structure, the entire horn now consists
of a bony core with a covering of skin; the inner, or dermal,
layer of the latter is richly supplied with nutrient blood-vessels,
while the outer layer, or epidermis, develops the fibrous or
chitinous material, chemically and morphologically akin to a
mass of cemented or consolidated hairs, which constitutes the
“sheath” of the horn. A zone of active growth at the base of
the horn keeps adding to this sheath, ring by ring, and the specific
form of this annular zone is, accordingly, that of the “generating
curve” of the horn. Each horn no longer lies, as it does in the
rhinoceros, in the plane of symmetry of the animal of which it
forms a part; and the limited field of force concerned in the
genesis and growth of the horn is bound, accordingly, to be more
or less laterally asymmetrical. But the two horns are in symmetry
one with another; they form “conjugate” spirals, one
being the “mirror-image” of the other. Just as in the hairy coat
of the animal each hair, on either side of the median “parting,”
tends to have a certain definite direction of its own axis, inclined
away from the median axial plane of the whole system, so is it
both with the bony core of the horn and with the consolidated
mass of hairs or hair-like substance which constitutes its sheath;
the primary axis of the horn is more or less inclined to, and may
even be nearly perpendicular to, the axial plane of the animal.</p>

<p>The growth of the horny sheath is not continuous,
but more or <span class="xxpn" id="p614">{614}</span>
less definitely periodic: sometimes, as in the sheep, this periodicity
is particularly well-marked, and causes the horny sheath to be
composed of a series of all but separate rings, which are supposed
to be formed year by year, and so to record the age of the animal<a class="afnanch" href="#fn560" id="fnanch560">560</a>.</p>

<p>Just as we sought for the true generating curve in the orifice,
or “lip,” of the molluscan shell, so we might be apt to assume
that in the spiral horn the generating curve corresponded to the
lip or margin of one of the horny rings or annuli. This annular
margin, or boundary of the ring, is usually a sinuous curve, not
lying in a plane, but such as would form the boundary of an
anticlastic surface of great complexity: to the meaning and origin
of which phenomenon we shall return presently. But, as we have
already seen in the case of the molluscan shell, the complexities
of the lip itself, or of the cor­re­spon­ding lines of growth upon the
shell, need not concern us in our study of the development of the
spiral: inasmuch as we may substitute for these actual boundary
lines, their “trace,” or projection on a plane perpendicular to the
axis—in other words the simple outline of a transverse section
of the whorl. In the horn, this transverse section is often circular
or nearly so, as in the oxen and many antelopes: it now and then
becomes of somewhat complicated polygonal outline, as in a
highland ram; but in many antelopes, and in most of the sheep,
the outline is that of an isosceles, or sometimes nearly equilateral
triangle, a form which is typically displayed, for instance, in
<i>Ovis Ammon</i>. The horn in this latter case is a trihedral prism,
whose three faces are, (1) an upper, or frontal face, in continuation
of the plane of the frontal bone; (2) an outer, or orbital, starting
from the upper margin of the orbit; and (3) an inner, or “nuchal,”
abutting on the parietal bone<a class="afnanch" href="#fn561" id="fnanch561">561</a>.
Along these three faces, and
their cor­re­spon­ding angles or edges, we can trace in the fibrous
substance of the horn a series of homologous
spirals, such as we <span class="xxpn" id="p615">{615}</span>
have called in a preceding chapter the “<i>ensemble</i> of generating
spirals” which constitute the surface.</p>

<p>In some few cases, of which the male musk ox is one of the
most notable, the horn is not developed in a continuous spiral
curve. It changes its shape as growth proceeds; and this, as
we have seen, is enough to show that it does not constitute a
logarithmic spiral. The reason is that the bony exostoses, or
horn-cores, about which the horny sheath is shaped and moulded,
neither grow continuously nor even remain of constant size after
attaining their full growth. But as the horns grow heavy the
bony core is bent downwards by their weight, and so guides</p>

<p class="pcontinue">
the growth of the horn in a new direction. Moreover as age advances,
the horn-core is further weakened and to a great extent absorbed:
and the horny sheath or horn proper, deprived of its support,
continues to grow, but in a flattened curve very different from
its original spiral<a class="afnanch" href="#fn562" id="fnanch562">562</a>.
The chamois is a somewhat analogous case.
Here the terminal, or oldest, part of the horn is curved; it tends
to assume a spiral form, though from its comparative shortness
it seems merely to be bent into a hook. But later on, the bony
core within, as it grows and strengthens, stiffens the horn, and
guides it into a straighter course or form.
The same phenomenon <span class="xxpn" id="p616">{616}</span>
of change of curvature, manifesting itself at the time when, or
the place where, the horn is freed from the support of the internal
core, is seen in a good many other antelopes (such as the hartebeest)
and in many buffaloes; and the cases where it is most manifest
appear to be those where the bony core is relatively short, or
relatively weak.</p>

 Wild Goat, <i>Capra sinaitica</i>. (After Sclater, from
 <i>P.Z.S.</i>)</div></div>

<p>But in the great majority of horns, we have no difficulty in
recognising a continuous logarithmic spiral, nor in referring it, as
before, to an unequal rate of growth (parallel to the axis) on two
opposite sides of the horn, the inequality maintaining a constant
ratio as long as growth proceeds. In certain antelopes, such as
the gemsbok, the spiral angle is very small, or in other words
the horn is very nearly straight; in other species of the same
genus Oryx, such as the Beisa antelope and the
Leucoryx, a gentle <span class="xxpn" id="p617">{617}</span>
curve (not unlike though generally less than that of a Dentalium
shell) is evident; and the spiral angle, according to the few
measurements I have made, is found to measure from about
20° to nearly 40°. In some of the large wild goats, such as the
Scinde wild goat, we have a beautiful logarithmic spiral, with a
constant angle of rather less than 70°; and we may easily arrange
a series of forms, such for example as the Siberian ibex, the
moufflon, <i>Ovis Ammon</i>, etc., and ending with the long-horned
Highland ram: in which, as we pass from one to another, we
recognise precisely homologous spirals, with an increasing angular
constant, the spiral angle being, for instance, about 75° or rather
less in <i>Ovis Ammon</i>, and in the Highland ram a very little more.
We have already seen that in the neighbourhood of 70° or 80°
a small change of angle makes a marked difference in the appearance
of the spire; and we know also that the actual length of the
horn makes a very striking difference, for the spiral becomes
especially conspicuous to the eye when a horn or shell is long
enough to shew several whorls, or at least a considerable part of
one entire whorl.</p>

<p>Even in the simplest cases, such as the wild goats, the spiral
is never (strictly speaking) a plane or discoid spiral: but in
greater or less degree there is always superposed upon the plane
logarithmic spiral a helical spiral in space. Sometimes the latter
is scarcely apparent, for the helical curvature is comparatively
small, and the horn (though long, as in the said wild goats) is not
nearly long enough to shew a complete convolution: at other
times, as in the ram, and still better in many antelopes, such as
the koodoo, the helicoid or corkscrew curve of the horn is its
most char­ac­ter­is­tic feature.</p>

<p>Accordingly we may study, as in the molluscan shell, the
helicoid component of the spire—in other words the variation in
what we have called (on p. <a href="#p555" title="go to pg. 555">555</a>) the angle <i>θ</i>. This factor it is
which, more than the constant angle of the logarithmic spiral,
imparts a char­ac­ter­is­tic appearance to the various species of
sheep, for instance to the various closely allied species of Asiatic
wild sheep, or Argali. In all of these the constant angle of the
logarithmic spiral is very much the same, but the shearing component
differs greatly. And thus the long drawn
out horns of <span class="xxpn" id="p618">{618}</span>
<i>Ovis Poli</i>, four feet or more from tip to tip, differ conspicuously
from those of <i>Ovis Ammon</i> or <i>O. hodgsoni</i>, in which a very similar
logarithmic spiral is wound (as it were) round a much blunter cone.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The ram’s horn then, like the snail’s shell, is a curve of double
curvature, in which one component has imposed upon the structure
a plane logarithmic spiral, and the other has produced a continuous
displacement, or “shear,” proportionate in magnitude to, and
perpendicular or otherwise inclined in direction to, the axis of
the former spiral curvature. The result is precisely analogous to
that which we have studied in the snail and other spiral univalves;
but while the form, and therefore the resultant forces, are similar,
the original distribution of force is not the same: for we have not
here, as we had in the snail-shell, a “columellar” muscle, to
introduce the component acting in the direction of the axis. We
have, it is true, the central bony core, which in part performs an
analogous function; but the main phenomenon here is apparently
a complex distribution of rates of growth, perpendicular to the
plane of the generating curve.</p>

<p>Let us continue to dispense with mathematics, for the math­e­mat­i­cal
treatment of a curve of double curvature is never very
simple, and let us deal with the matter by experiment. We have
seen that the generating curve, or transverse section, of a typical
ram’s horn is triangular in form. Measuring (along the curve of
the horn) the length of the three edges of the trihedral structure
in a specimen of <i>Ovis Ammon</i>, and calling them respectively the
outer, inner, and hinder edges (from their position at the base of
the horn, relatively to the skull), I find the outer edge to measure
80 cm., the inner 74 cm., and the posterior 45 cm.; let us say
that, roughly, they are in the ratio of 9&#x202f;:&#x202f;8&#x202f;:&#x202f;5. Then, if we make
a number of little cardboard triangles, equip each with three little
legs (I make them of cork), whose relative lengths are as 9&#x202f;:&#x202f;8&#x202f;:&#x202f;5,
and pile them up and stick them all together, we straightway
build up a curve of double curvature precisely analogous to the
ram’s horn: except only that, in this first approximation, we have
not allowed for the gradual increment (or decrement) of the
triangular surfaces, that is to say, for the <i>tapering</i> of the horn
due to the growth in its own plane of
the generating curve. <span class="xxpn" id="p619">{619}</span></p>

<p>In this case then, and in most other trihedral or three-sided
horns, one of the three components, or three unequal velocities of
growth, is of relatively small magnitude, but the other two are
nearly equal one to the other. It would involve but little change
for these latter to become precisely equal; and again but little to
turn the balance of inequality the other way. But the immediate
consequence of this altered ratio of growth would be that the
horn would appear to wind the other way, as it does in the
antelopes, and also in certain goats, e.g. the markhor, <i>Capra
falconeri</i>.</p>

<div class="psmprnt3">
<p>For these two opposite directions of twist Dr Wherry has introduced a
convenient nomenclature. When the horn winds so that we follow it from
base to apex in the direction of the hands of a watch, it is customary to call
it a “left-handed” spiral. Such a spiral we have in the horn on the left-hand
side of a ram’s head. Accordingly, Dr Wherry calls the condition <i>homonymous</i>,
where, as in the sheep, a right-handed spiral is on the right side of the head,
and a left-handed spiral on the left side; while he calls the opposite condition
<i>heteronymous</i>, as we have it in the antelopes, where the right-handed twist
is on the left side of the head, and the left-handed twist on the right-hand side.
Among the goats, we may have either condition. Thus the domestic and
most of the wild goats agree with the sheep; but in the markhor the twisted
horns are heteronymous, as in the antelopes. The difference, as we have
seen, is easily explained; and (very much as in the case of our opposite spirals
in the apple-snail, referred to on p. <a href="#p560" title="go to pg. 560">560</a>), it has no very deep importance.</p>
</div><!--psmprnt3-->

<p>Summarised then, in a very few words, the argument by which
we account for the spiral conformation of the horn is as follows:
The horn elongates by dint of continual growth within a narrow
zone, or annulus, at its base. If the rate of growth be identical
on all sides of this zone, the horn will grow straight; if it be
greater on one side than on the other, the horn will become curved:
and it probably <i>will</i> be greater on one side than on the other,
because each single horn occupies an unsymmetrical field with
reference to the plane of symmetry of the animal. If the maximal
and minimal velocities of growth be precisely at opposite sides
of the zone of growth, the resultant spiral will be a plane spiral;
but if they be not precisely or diametrically opposite, then the
spiral will be a spiral in space, with a winding or helical component;
and it is by no means likely that the maximum and
minimum <i>will</i> occur at precisely opposite ends of
a diameter, for <span class="xxpn" id="p620">{620}</span>
no such plane of symmetry is manifested in the field of force to
which the growing annulus corresponds or appertains.</p>

<p>Now we must carefully remember that the rates of growth of
which we are here speaking are the net rates of longitudinal
increment, in which increment the activity of the living cells in
the zone of growth at the base of the horn is only one (though it
is the fundamental) factor. In other words, if the horny sheath
were continually being added to with equal rapidity all round its
zone of active growth, but at the same time had its elongation
more retarded on one side than the other (prior to its complete
solidification) by varying degrees of adhesion or membranous
attachment to the bone core within, then the net result would be
a spiral curve precisely such as would have arisen from initial
inequalities in the rate of growth itself. It seems highly probable
that this is a very important factor, and sometimes even the
chief factor in the case. The same phenomenon of attachment to
the bony core, and the consequent friction or retardation with
which the sheath slides over its surface, will lead to various
subsidiary phenomena: among others to the presence of transverse
folds or corrugations upon the horn, and to their unequal distribution
upon its several faces or edges. And while it is perfectly true
that nearly all the characters of the horn can be accounted
for by unequal velocities of longitudinal growth upon its different
sides, it is also plain that the actual field of force is a very complicated
one indeed. For example, we can easily see that (at least
in the great majority of cases) the direction of growth of the
horny fibres of the sheath is by no means parallel to the axis of
the core within; accordingly these fibres will tend to wind in a
system of helicoid curves around the core, and not only this
helicoid twist but any other tendency to spiral curvature on the
part of the sheath will tend to be opposed or modified by the
resistance of the core within. But on the other hand living bone
is a very plastic structure, and yields easily though slowly to any
forces tending to its deformation; and so, to a considerable
extent, the bony core itself will tend to be modelled by the curvature
which the growing sheath assumes, and the final result will
be determined by an equi­lib­rium between these two systems of
forces. <span class="xxpn" id="p621">{621}</span></p>

<p>While it is not very safe, perhaps, to lay down any general
rule as to what horns are more, and what are less spirally curved,
I think it may be said that, on the whole, the thicker the horn,
the greater is its spiral curvature. It is the slender horns, of such
forms as the Beisa antelope, which are gently curved, and it is
the robust horns of goats or of sheep in which the curvature is
more pronounced. Other things being the same, this is what we
should expect to find; for it is where the transverse section of
the horn is large that we may expect to find the more marked
differences in the intensity of the field of force, whether of active
growth or of retardation, on opposite sides or in different sectors
thereof.</p>

 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 320. Head of <i>Ovis Ammon</i>, shewing St
Venant’s curves.</div></div>

<p>But there is yet another and a very remarkable phenomenon
which we may discern in the growth of a horn, when it takes the
form of a curve of double curvature, namely, an effect of torsional
strain; and this it is which gives rise to the sinuous “lines of
growth,” or sinuous boundaries of the separate horny rings, of
which we have already spoken. It is not at first sight obvious
that a mechanical strain of torsion is necessarily involved in the
growth of the horn. In our experimental illustration (p. <a href="#p618" title="go to pg. 618">618</a>), we
built up a twisted coil of separate elements, and no torsional
strain attended the development of the system. So would it
be if the horny sheath grew by successive annular increments,
free save for their relation to one another, and having no attachment
to the solid core within. But as a matter of
fact there is <span class="xxpn" id="p622">{622}</span>
such an attachment, by subcutaneous connective tissue, to the
bony core; and accordingly a torsional strain will be set up in
the growing horny sheath, again provided that the forces of growth
therein be directed more or less obliquely to the axis of the core;
for a “couple” is thus introduced, giving rise to a strain which
the sheath would not experience were it free (so to speak) to slip
along, impelled only by the pressure of its own growth from below.
And furthermore, the successive small increments of the growing
horn (that is to say, of the horny sheath) are not instantaneously
converted from living to solid and rigid substance; but there is
an intermediate stage, probably long-continued, during which
the new-formed horny substance in the neighbourhood of the zone
of active growth is still plastic and capable of deformation.</p>

<p>Now we know, from the celebrated experiments of St Venant<a class="afnanch" href="#fn563" id="fnanch563">563</a>,
that in the torsion of an elastic body, other than a cylinder of
circular section, a very remarkable state of strain is introduced.
If the body be thus cylindrical (whether solid or hollow), then a
twist leaves each circular section unchanged, in dimensions and
in figure. But in all other cases, such as an elliptic rod or a
prism of any particular sectional form, forces are introduced which
act parallel to the axis of the structure, and which warp each
section into a complex anticlastic surface. Thus in the case of a
triangular and equilateral prism, such as is shewn in section in
Fig. <a href="#fig321" title="go to Fig. 321">321</a>, if the part of the rod represented in the section be twisted
by a force acting in the direction of the arrow, then the originally
plane section will be warped as indicated in the diagram:—where
the full contour-lines represent elevation above, and the dotted
lines represent depression below, the original level. On the
external surface of the prism, then, contour-lines which were
originally parallel and horizontal, will be found warped into sinuous
curves, such that, on each of the three faces, the curve will be
convex upwards on one half, and concave upwards on the other
half of the face. The ram’s horn, and still better that of <i>Ovis
Ammon</i>, is comparable to such a prism, save that in section it
is not quite equilateral, and that its three faces are not plane.
The warping is therefore not precisely identical
on the three faces <span class="xxpn" id="p623">{623}</span>
of the horn; but, in the general distribution of the curves, it is
in complete accordance with theory. Similar anticlastic curves
are well seen in many antelopes; but they are conspicuous by
their absence in the <i>cylindrical</i> horns of oxen.</p>

<p>The better to illustrate this phenomenon, the nature of which
is indeed obvious enough from a superficial examination of the
horn, I made a plaster cast of one of the horny rings in a horn of
<i>Ovis Ammon</i>, so as to get an accurate pattern of its sinuous edge:
and then, filling the mould up with wet clay, I modelled an anticlastic
surface, such as to correspond as nearly as possible with
the sinuous outline<a class="afnanch" href="#fn564" id="fnanch564">564</a>.
Finally, after making a plaster cast of this
sectional surface, I drew its contour-lines (as shewn in Fig. <a href="#fig322" title="go to Fig. 322">322</a>),
with the help of a simple form of spherometer. It will be seen
that in great part this diagram is precisely</p>

<p class="pcontinue">similar to St Venant’s
diagram of the cross-section of a twisted triangular prism; and
this is especially the case in the neighbourhood of the sharp angle
of our prismatic section. That in parts the diagram is somewhat
asymmetrical is not to be wondered at: and (apart from inaccuracies
due to the somewhat rough means by which it was made)
this asymmetry can be sufficiently accounted for by anisotropy
of the material, by inequalities in thickness of different parts of
the horny sheath, and especially (I think) by unequal distributions
of rigidity due to the presence of the smaller
corrugations of the <span class="xxpn" id="p624">{624}</span>
horn. It is apparently on account of these minor corrugations
that, in such horns as the Highland ram’s, where they are strongly
marked, the main St Venant effect is not nearly so well shewn as
in the smoother horns such as those of <i>O. Ammon</i> and its immediate
congeners<a class="afnanch" href="#fn565" id="fnanch565">565</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3><i>A further Note upon Torsion.</i></h3></div>

<p>The phenomenon of torsion, to which we have been thus
introduced, opens up many wide questions in connection with
form. Some of the associated phenomena are admirably illustrated
in the case of climbing plants; but we can only deal with these
still more briefly and parenthetically.</p>

<p>The subject of climbing plants has been elaborately dealt
with not only in Darwin’s books<a class="afnanch" href="#fn566" id="fnanch566">566</a>,
but also by a very large number
of earlier and later writers. In “twining” plants, which constitute
the greater number of “climbers,” the essential phenomenon is a
tendency of the growing shoot to revolve about a vertical axis—a
tendency long ago discussed and investigated by such writers
as Palm, H. von Mohl and Dutrochet<a class="afnanch" href="#fn567" id="fnanch567">567</a>.
This tendency to
revolution—“circumvolution,”
as Darwin calls it, “revolving nutation,”
as Sachs puts it—is very closely comparable to the process by which
an antelope’s horn (such as the koodoo’s) grows into its spiral
or rather helicoid form; and it is simply due, in like manner, to
inequalities in the rate of growth on different sides of the growing
stem. There is only this difference between the two cases, that
in the antelope’s horn the zone of active growth is confined to
the base of the horn, while in the climbing stem the same
phenomenon is at work throughout the whole length of the growing
structure. This growth is in the main due to “turgescence,”
that is to the extension, or elongation, of ready-formed cells
through the imbibition of water; it is a phenomenon due to
osmotic pressure. The particular stimuli to which these movements
(that is to say, these inequalities of growth)
have been <span class="xxpn" id="p625">{625}</span>
ascribed, such as contact (thigmotaxis), exposure to light
(heliotropism), and so forth, need not be discussed here<a class="afnanch" href="#fn568" id="fnanch568">568</a>.</p>

<p>A simple stem growing upright in the dark, or in uniformly
diffused light, would be in a position of equi­lib­rium to a field of
force radially symmetrical about its vertical axis. But this
complete radial symmetry will not often occur; and the radial
anomalies may be such as arise intrinsically from structural
peculiarities in the stem itself, or externally to it by reason of
unequal illumination or through various other localised forces.
The essential fact, so far as we are concerned, is that in twining
plants we have a very marked tendency to inequalities in longitudinal
growth on different aspects of the stem—a tendency which
is but an exaggerated manifestation of one which is more or less
present, under certain conditions, in all plants whatsoever. Just
as in the case of the ruminants’ horns so we find here, that this
inequality may be, so to speak, positive or negative, the maximum
lying to the one side or the other of the twining stem; and so it
comes to pass that some climbers twine to the one side and some
to the other: the hop and the honeysuckle following the sun,
and the field-convolvulus twining in the reverse direction; there
are also some, like the woody nightshade (<i>Solanum Dulcamara</i>)
which twine indifferently either way.</p>

<p>Together with this circumnutatory movement, there is very
generally to be seen an actual <i>torsion</i> of the twining stem—a
twist, that is to say, about its own axis; and Mohl made the
curious observation, confirmed by Darwin, that when a stem
twines around a smooth cylindrical stick the torsion does not take
place, save “only in that degree which follows as a mechanical
necessity from the spiral winding”: but that stems which had
climbed around a rough stick were all more or less, and generally
much, twisted. Here Darwin did not refrain from introducing
that teleological argument which pervades his whole train of
reasoning: “The stem,” he says, “probably gains rigidity by
being twisted (on the same principle that a much
twisted rope <span class="xxpn" id="p626">{626}</span>
is stiffer than a slackly twisted one), and is thus indirectly
benefited so as to be able to pass over inequalities in its spiral
ascent, and to carry its own weight when allowed to revolve
freely.” The mechanical explanation would appear to be very
simple, and such as to render the teleological hypothesis unnecessary.
In the case of the roughened support, there is a
temporary adhesion or “clinging” between it and the growing
stem which twines around it; and a system of forces is thus set
up, producing a “couple,” just as it was in the case of the ram’s
or antelope’s horn through direct adhesion of the bony core to
the surrounding sheath. The twist is the direct result of this
couple, and it disappears when the support is so smooth that no
such force comes to be exerted.</p>

<p>Another important class of climbers includes the so-called
“leaf-climbers.” In these, some portion of the leaf, generally the
petiole, sometimes (as in the fumitory) the elongated midrib,
curls round a support; and a phenomenon of like nature occurs
in many, though not all, of the so-called “tendril-bearers.”
Except that a different part of the plant, leaf or tendril instead of
stem, is concerned in the twining process, the phenomenon here
is strictly analogous to our former case; but in the resulting
helix there is, as a rule, this obvious difference, that, while the
twining stem, for instance of the hop, makes a slow revolution
about its support, the typical leaf-climber makes a close, firm
coil: the axis of the latter is nearly perpendicular and parallel
to the axis of its support, while in the twining stem the angle
between the two axes is comparatively small. Mathematically
speaking, the difference merely amounts to this, that the component
in the direction of the vertical axis is large in the one
case, and the cor­re­spon­ding component is small, if not absent,
in the other; in other words, we have in the climbing stem a
considerable vertical component, due to its own tendency to grow
in height, while this longitudinal or vertical extension of the
whole system is not apparent, or little apparent, in the other
cases. But from the fact that the twining stem tends to run
obliquely to its support, and the coiling petiole of the leaf-climber
tends to run transversely to the axis of its support, there
immediately follows this marked difference,
that the phenomenon <span class="xxpn" id="p627">{627}</span>
of <i>torsion</i>, so manifest in the former case, will be absent in the
latter.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>There is one other phenomenon which meets us in the twining
and twisted stem, and which is doubtless illustrated also, though
not so well, in the antelope’s horn; it is a phenomenon which
forms the subject of a second chapter of St Venant’s researches on
the effects of torsional strain in elastic bodies. We have already
seen how one effect of torsion, in for instance a prism, is to
produce strains parallel to the axis, elevating parts and depressing
other parts of each transverse section. But in addition to this,
the same torsion has the effect of materially altering the form of
the section itself, as we may easily see by twisting a square or
oblong piece of india-rubber. If we start with a cylinder, such as
a round piece of catapult india-rubber, and twist it on its own
long axis, we have already seen that it suffers no other distortion;
it still remains a cylinder, that is to say, it is still in section everywhere
circular. But if it be of any other shape than cylindrical
the case is quite different, for now the sectional shape tends to
alter under the strain of torsion. Thus, if our rod be elliptical
in section to begin with, it will, under torsion, become a more
elongated ellipse; if it be square, its angles will become more
prominent, and its sides will curve inwards, till at length the
square assumes the appearance of a four-pointed star, with
rounded angles. Furthermore, looking at the results of this
process of modification, we find experimentally that the resultant
figures are more easily twisted, less resistant to torsion, than
were those from which we evolved them; and this is a very
curious physical or math­e­mat­i­cal fact. So a cylinder, which is
especially resistant to torsion, is very easily bent or flexed; while
projecting ribs or angles, such as an engineer makes in a bar or
pillar of iron for the purpose of greatly increasing its strength in
the way of resistance to <i>bending</i>, actually make it much weaker
than before (for the same amount of metal per unit length) in the
way of resistance to <i>torsion</i>.</p>

<p>In the hop itself, and in a very considerable number of other
twining and twisting stems, the ribbed or channelled form of the
stem is a conspicuous feature. We may safely take
it, (1) that <span class="xxpn" id="p628">{628}</span>
such stems are especially susceptible of torsion; and (2) that the
effect of torsion will be to intensify any such peculiarities of
sectional outline which they may possess, though not to initiate
them in an originally cylindrical structure. In the leaf-climbers
the case does not present itself, for there, as we have seen, torsion
itself is not, or is very slightly, manifested. There are very
distinct traces of the phenomenon in the horns of certain antelopes,
but the reason why it is not a more conspicuous feature of the
antelope’s horn or of the ram’s is apparently a very simple one:
namely, that the presence of the bony core within tends to check
that deformation which is perpendicular, while it permits that
which is parallel, to the axis of the horn.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3><i>Of Deer’s Antlers.</i></h3></div>

<p>But let us return to our subject of the shapes of horns,
and consider briefly our last class of these structures,
namely the bony antlers of the various species of elk and
deer<a class="afnanch" href="#fn569" id="fnanch569">569</a>.
The problems which these present to us are very different from
those which we have had to do with in the antelope or the
sheep.</p>

<p>With regard to its structure, it is plain that the bony antler
corresponds, upon the whole, to the bony core of the antelope’s
horn; while in place of the hard horny sheath of the latter, we
have the soft “velvet,” which every season covers the new growing
antler, and protects the large nutrient blood-vessels by help of
which the antler grows<a class="afnanch" href="#fn570" id="fnanch570">570</a>.
The main difference lies in the fact
that, in the one case, the bony core, imprisoned within its sheath,
is rendered incapable of branching and incapable also of lateral
expansion, and the whole horn is only permitted to grow in length,
while retaining a sectional contour that is identical with (or but
little altered from) that which it possesses
at its growing base: <span class="xxpn" id="p629">{629}</span>
but in the antler, on the other hand, no such restraint is imposed,
and the living, growing fabric of bone may expand into a broad
flattened plate over which the blood-vessels run. In the immediate
neighbourhood of the main blood-vessels growth will be most
active; in the interspaces between, it may wholly fail: with the
result that we may have great notches cut out of the flattened
plate, or may at length find it reduced to the form of a simple
branching structure. The main point, as it seems to me, is that
the “horn” is essentially an <i>axial rod</i>, while the “antler” is</p>

<div class="dctr01" id="fig323">
<img src="images/i629.png" width="800" height="477" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 323. Antlers of Swedish Elk.
(After Lönnberg, from <i>P.Z.S.</i>)</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue"> essentially an outspread <i>surface</i>&#xfeff;<a
class="afnanch" href="#fn571" id="fnanch571">571</a>. In
other words, I believe that the whole configuration of an
antler is more easily understood by conceiving it as a
plate or a surface, more and more notched and scolloped
till but a slender skeleton may remain, than to look upon
it the other way, namely as an axial stem (or beam) giving
<span class="xxpn" id="p630">{630}</span> off branches (or
tines), the interspaces between which latter may sometimes
be filled up to form a continuous plate.</p>

<p>In a sense it matters very little whether we regard the broad
plate-like antlers of the elk or the slender branching antlers of the
stag as the more primitive type; for we are not concerned here
with the question of hypothetical phylogeny. And even from the
math­e­mat­i­cal point of view it makes little or no difference whether
we describe the plate as constituted by the interconnection of
the branches, or the branches derived by a</p>

<p class="pcontinue">
process of notching
or incision from the plate. The important point for us is to
recognise that (save for occasional slight irregularities) the
branching system in the one <i>conforms</i> essentially to the curved
plate or surface which we see plainly in the other. In short the
arrangement of the branches is more or less comparable to that
of the veins in a leaf, or to that of the blood-vessels as they course
over the curved surface of an organ. It is a process of ramification,
not, like that of a tree, in various planes,
but strictly limited <span class="xxpn" id="p631">{631}</span>
to a single surface. And just as the veins within a leaf are not
necessarily confined (as they happen to be in most ordinary
leaves) to a <i>plane</i> surface, but, as in the petal of a tulip or the
capsule of a poppy, may have to run their course within a curved
surface, so does the analogy of the leaf lead us directly to the
mode of branching which is char­ac­ter­is­tic of the antler. The
surface to which the branches of the antler tend to be confined
is a more or less spheroidal, or occasionally an ellipsoidal one;
and furthermore, when we inspect any well-developed pair of
antlers, such as those of a red deer, a sambur or a wapiti, we have
no difficulty in seeing that the two antlers make up between them
<i>a single surface</i>, and constitute a symmetrical figure, each half
being the mirror-image of the other.</p>

<p>To put the case in another way, a pair of antlers (apart from
occasional slight irregularities) tends to constitute a figure such
that we could conceive an elastic sheet stretched over or round
the entire system, so as to form one continuous and even surface;
and not only would the surface curvature be on the whole smooth
and even, but the boundary of the surface would also tend to be
an even curve: that is to say the tips of all the tines would
ap­prox­i­mate­ly have their locus in a continuous curve.</p>

<p>It follows from this that if we want to make a simple model of
a set of antlers, we shall be very greatly helped by taking some
appropriate spheroidal surface as our groundwork or scaffolding.
The best form of surface is a matter for trial and in­ves­ti­ga­tion in
each particular case; but even in a sphere, by selecting appropriate
areas thereof, we can obtain sufficient varieties of surface to meet
all ordinary cases. With merely a bit of sculptor’s clay or plasticine,
we should be put hard to it to model the horns of a wapiti
or a reindeer: but if we start with an orange (or a round florence
flask) and lay our little tapered rolls of plasticine upon it, in simple
natural curves, it is surprising to see how quickly and successfully
we can imitate one type of antler after another. In doing so,
we shall be struck by the fact that our model may vary in its
mode of branching within very considerable limits, and yet look
perfectly natural. For the same wide range of variation is char­ac­ter­is­tic
of the natural antlers themselves. As Sir V. Brooke says
(<i>op. cit.</i> p. 892), “No two antlers are ever exactly
alike; and the <span class="xxpn" id="p632">{632}</span>
variation to which the antlers are subject is so great that in the
absence of a large series they would be held to be indicative of
several distinct species<a class="afnanch" href="#fn572" id="fnanch572">572</a>.”
But all these many variations lie
within a limited range, for they are all subject to our general
rule that the entire structure is essentially confined to a single
curved surface.</p>

<p>It is plain that in the curvatures both of the beam and of its
tines, in the angles by which these latter meet the beam, and in
the contours of the entire system, there are involved many elegant
math­e­mat­i­cal problems with which we cannot at present attempt
to deal. Nor must we attempt meanwhile to enquire into the
physical meaning or origin of these phenomena, for as yet the clue
seems to be lacking and we should only heap one hypothesis upon
another. That there is a complete contrast of math­e­mat­i­cal
properties between the horn and the antler is the main lesson with
which, in the meantime, we must rest content.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3><i>Of Teeth, and of Beak and Claw.</i></h3></div>

<p>In a fashion similar to that manifested in the shell or the
horn, we find the logarithmic spiral to be implicit in a great many
other organic structures where the phenomena of growth proceed
in a similar way: that is to say, where about an axis there is some
asymmetry leading to unequal rates of longitudinal growth, and
where the structure is of such a kind that each new increment is
added on as a permanent and unchanging part of the entire
conformation. Nail and claw, beak and tooth, all come under
this category. The logarithmic spiral <i>always</i> tends to manifest
itself in such structures as these, though it usually only attracts
our attention in elongated structures, where (that is to say) the
radius vector has described a considerable angle. When the
canary-bird’s claws grow long from lack of use, or when the
incisor tooth of a rabbit or a rat grows long by reason of an injury
to the opponent tooth against which it was wont to bite, we know
that the tooth or claw tends to grow into a spiral curve, and we
speak of it as a malformation. But there has been no fundamental
change of form, save only an abnormal
increase in length; <span class="xxpn" id="p633">{633}</span>
the elongated tooth or claw has the selfsame curvature that it had
when it was short, but the spiral curvature becomes more and more
manifest the longer it grows. A curious analogous case is that
of the New Zealand huia bird, in which the beak of the female
is described as being comparatively short and straight, while that
of the male is long and curved; it is easy to see that there is a
slight curvature also in the beak of the female, and that the beak
of the male shows nothing but the same curve produced. In the
case of the more curved beaks, such as those of an eagle or a parrot,
we may, if we please, determine the constant angle of the logarithmic
spiral, just as we have done in the case of the Nautilus
shell; and here again, as the bird grows older or the beak longer,
the spiral nature of the curve becomes more and more apparent,
as in the hooked beak of an old eagle, or as in the great beak of
some large parrot such as a hyacinthine macaw.</p>

<p>Let us glance at one or two instances to illustrate the spiral
curvature of teeth.</p>

<p>A dentist knows that every tooth has a curvature of its own,
and that in pulling the tooth he must follow the direction of the
curve; but in an ordinary tooth this curvature is scarcely visible,
and is least so when the diameter of the tooth is large compared
with its length.</p>

<p>In the simply formed, more or less conical teeth, such as are
those of the dolphin, and in the more or less similarly shaped canines
and incisors of mammals in general, the curvature of the tooth
is particularly well seen. We see it in the little teeth of a hedgehog,
and in the canines of a dog or a cat it is very obvious indeed.
When the great canine of the carnivore becomes still further
enlarged or elongated, as in Machairodus, it grows into the
strongly curved sabre-tooth of that great extinct tiger. In rodents,
it is the incisors which undergo a great elongation; their rate of
growth differs, though but slightly, on the two sides, anterior and
posterior, of the axis, and by summation of these slight differences
in the rapid growth of the tooth an unmistakeable logarithmic
spiral is gradually built up. We see it admirably in the beaver,
or in the great ground-rat, Geomys. The elephant is a similar
case, save that the tooth, or tusk, remains, owing to comparative
lack of wear, in a more perfect condition. In the rodent (save
only in those abnormal cases mentioned on the
last page) the <span class="xxpn" id="p634">{634}</span>
anterior, first-formed, part of the tooth wears away as fast as it
is added to from behind; and in the grown animal, all those
portions of the tooth near to the pole of the logarithmic spiral
have long disappeared. In the elephant, on the other hand, we
see, practically speaking, the whole unworn tooth, from point to
root; and its actual tip nearly coincides with the pole of the
spiral. If we assume (as with no great inaccuracy we may do)
that the tip actually coincides with the pole, then we may very
easily construct the continuous spiral of which the existing tusk
constitutes a part; and by so doing, we see the short, gently
curved tusk of our ordinary elephant growing gradually into the
spiral tusk of the mammoth. No doubt, just as in the case of
our molluscan shells, we have a tendency to variation, both
individual and specific, in the constant angle of the spiral; some
elephants, and some species of elephant, undoubtedly have a
higher spiral angle than others. But in most cases, the angle
would seem to be such that a spiral configuration would become
very manifest indeed if only the tusk pursued its steady growth,
unchanged otherwise in form, till it attained the dimensions
which we meet with in the mammoth. In a species such as
<i>Mastodon angustidens</i>, or <i>M. arvernensis</i>, the specific angle is
low and the tusk comparatively straight; but the American
mastodons and the existing species of elephant have tusks which
do not differ appreciably, except in size, from the great spiral
tusks of the mammoth, though from their comparative shortness
the spiral is little developed and only appears to the eye as a
gentle curve. Wherever the tooth is very long indeed, as in the
mammoth or the beaver, the effect of some slight and all but
inevitable lateral asymmetry in the rate of growth begins to shew
itself: in other words, the spiral is seen to lie not absolutely in
a plane, but to be a curve of double curvature, like a twisted
horn. We see this condition very well in the huge canine tusks
of the Babirussa; it is a conspicuous feature in the mammoth,
and it is more or less perceptible in any large tusk of the ordinary
elephants.</p>

<p>The form of a molar tooth, which is essentially a branching or
budding system, and in which such longitudinal growth as gives
rise to a spiral curve is but little manifest, constitutes an entirely
different problem with which I shall not at present
attempt to deal.</p>

petals of a lotus or the florets in a sunflower.</p>

<p>The spiral leaf-order has been regarded by many learned
botanists as involving a fundamental law of growth, of the deepest
and most far-reaching importance; while others, such as Sachs,
have looked upon the whole doctrine of “phyllotaxis” as “a sort
of geometrical or arithmetical playing with ideas,” and “the
spiral theory as a mode of view gratuitously introduced into the
plant.” Sachs even goes so far as to declare this doctrine “in
direct opposition to scientific in­ves­ti­ga­tion, and based upon the
idealistic direction of the Naturphilosophie,”—the mystical biology
of Oken and his school.</p>

<p>The essential facts of the case are not difficult to understand;
but the theories built upon them are so varied, so conflicting, and
sometimes so obscure, that we must not attempt to submit them
to detailed analysis and criticism. There are two chief ways by
which we may approach the question, according to whether we
regard, as the more fundamental and typical, one or other of the
two chief modes in which the phenomenon presents itself. That
is to say, we may hold that the phenomenon is displayed in its
essential simplicity by the corkscrew spirals, or helices, which
mark the position of the leaves upon a cylindrical stem
or on an <span class="xxpn" id="p636">{636}</span>
elongated fir-cone; or, on the other hand, we may be more
attracted by, and regard as of greater importance, the logarithmic
spirals which we trace in the curving rows of florets in the discoidal
inflorescence of a sunflower. Whether one way or the other be
the better, or even whether one be not positively correct and the
other radically wrong, has been vehemently debated. In my
judgment they are, both math­e­mat­i­cally and biologically, to be
regarded as inseparable and correlative phenomena.</p>

<p>The helical arrangement (as in the fir-cone) was carefully
studied in the middle of the eighteenth century by the celebrated
Bonnet, with the help of Calandrini, the mathematician. Memoirs
published about 1835, by Schimper and Braun, greatly amplified
Bonnet’s investigations, and introduced a nomenclature which
still holds its own in botanical textbooks. Naumann and the
brothers Bravais are among those who continued the in­ves­ti­ga­tion
in the years immediately following, and Hofmeister, in 1868, gave
an admirable account and summary of the work of these and
many other writers<a class="afnanch" href="#fn573" id="fnanch573">573</a>.</p>

<p>Starting from some given level and proceeding upwards, let
us mark the position of some one leaf (<i>A</i>) upon a cylindrical stem.
Another, and a younger leaf (<i>B</i>) will be found standing at a certain
distance <i>around</i> the stem, and a certain distance
<i>along</i> the stem, <span class="xxpn" id="p637">{637}</span>
from the first. The former distance may be expressed as a
fractional “divergence” (such as two-fifths of the circumference
of the stem) as the botanists describe it, or by an “angle of
azimuth” (such as ϕ
=&#x202f;144°) as the mathematician would be more
likely to state it. The position of <i>B</i> relatively to <i>A</i> must be
determined, not only by this angle ϕ, in the horizontal plane, but
also by an angle (θ) in the vertical plane; for the height of <i>B</i> above
the level of <i>A</i>, in comparison with the diameter of the cylinder,
will obviously make a great difference in the appearance of the
whole system, in short the position of each leaf must be expressed
by <i>F</i>(ϕ&#x202f;·&#x202f;sin&#x202f;θ). But this matter botanical students have not
concerned themselves with; in other words, their studies have
been limited (or mainly limited) to the relation of the leaves to
one another in <i>azimuth</i>.</p>

<p>Whatever relation we have found between <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, let
precisely the same relation subsist between <i>B</i> and <i>C</i>: and so on.
Let the growth of the system, that is to say, be continuous and
uniform; it is then evident that we have the elementary conditions
for the development of a simple cylindrical helix; and this
“primary helix” or “genetic spiral” we can now trace, winding
round and round the stem, through <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, etc. But if we can
trace such a helix through <i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, it follows from the symmetry
of the system, that we have only to join <i>A</i> to some other leaf to
trace another spiral helix, such, for instance, as <i>A</i>, <i>C</i>, <i>E</i>, etc.;
parallel to which will run another and similar one, namely in this
case <i>B</i>, <i>D</i>, <i>F</i>, etc. And these spirals will run in the opposite
direction to the spiral <i>ABC</i>.</p>

<p>In short, the existence of one helical arrangement of points
implies and involves the existence of another and then another
helical pattern, just as, in the pattern of a wall-paper, our eye
travels from one linear series to another.</p>

<p>A modification of the helical system will be introduced when,
instead of the leaves appearing, or standing, in singular succession,
we get two or more appearing simultaneously upon the same level.
If there be two such, then we shall have two generating spirals
precisely equivalent to one another; and we may call them
<i>A</i>, <i>B</i>, <i>C</i>, etc., and <i>A&#xfeff;′</i>, <i>B&#xfeff;′</i>, <i>C&#xfeff;′</i>, and so on. These are the cases
which we call “whorled” leaves, or in the
simplest case, where <span class="xxpn" id="p638">{638}</span>
the whorl consists of two opposite leaves only, we call them
decussate.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Among the phenomena of phyllotaxis, two points in particular
have been found difficult of explanation, and have aroused discussion.
These are (1), the presence of the logarithmic spirals
such as we have already spoken of in the sunflower; and (2) the
fact that, as regards the number of the helical or spiral rows,
certain numerical coincidences are apt to recur again and again,
to the exclusion of others, and so to become char­ac­ter­is­tic features
of the phenomenon.</p>

<p>The first of these appears to me to present no difficulty. It
is a mere matter of strictly math­e­mat­i­cal “deformation.” The
stem which we have begun to speak of as a cylinder is not strictly
so, inasmuch as it tapers off towards its summit. The curve
which winds evenly around this stem is, accordingly, not a true
helix, for that term is confined to the curve which winds evenly
around the <i>cylinder</i>: it is a curve in space which (like the spiral
curve we have studied in our turbinate shells) partakes of the
characters of a helix and of a logarithmic spiral, and which is in
fact a logarithmic spiral with its pole drawn out of its original
plane by a force acting in the direction of the axis. If we imagine
a tapering cylinder, or cone, projected, by vertical projection, on
a plane, it becomes a circular disc; and a helix described about
the cone necessarily becomes in the disc a logarithmic spiral
described about a focus which corresponds to the apex of our cone.
In like manner we may project an identical spiral in space upon
such surfaces as (for instance) a portion of a sphere or of an ellipsoid;
and in all these cases we preserve the spiral configuration, which
is the more clearly brought into view the more we reduce the
vertical component by which it was accompanied. The converse
is, of course, equally true, and equally obvious, namely that any
logarithmic spiral traced upon a circular disc or spheroidal surface
will be transformed into a cor­re­spon­ding spiral helix when the
plane or spheroidal disc is extended into an elongated cone
approximating to a cylinder. This math­e­mat­i­cal conception is
translated, in botany, into actual fact. The fir-cone may be
looked upon as a cylindrical axis contracted at
both ends, until <span class="xxpn" id="p639">{639}</span>
it becomes ap­prox­i­mate­ly an ellipsoidal solid of revolution,
generated about the long axis of the ellipse; and the semi-ellipsoidal
capitulum of the teasel, the more or less hemispherical one
of the thistle, and the flattened but still convex one of the sunflower,
are all beautiful and successive deformations of what is
typically a long, conical, and all but cylindrical stem. On the
other hand, every stem as it grows out into its long cylindrical
shape is but a deformation of the little spheroidal or ellipsoidal
surface, or cone, which was its forerunner in the bud.</p>

<p>This identity of the helical spirals around the stem with spirals
projected on a plane was clearly recognised by Hofmeister, who
was accustomed to represent his diagrams of leaf-arrangement
either in one way or the other, though not in a strictly geometrical
projection<a class="afnanch" href="#fn574" id="fnanch574">574</a>.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>According to Mr A. H. Church<a class="afnanch" href="#fn575" id="fnanch575">575</a>,
who has dealt very carefully
and elaborately with the whole question of phyllotaxis, the
logarithmic spirals such as we see in the disc of the sunflower have
a far greater importance and a far deeper meaning than this brief
treatment of mine would accord to them: and Sir Theodore Cook,
in his book on the <i>Curves of Life</i>, has adopted and has helped to
expound and popularise Mr Church’s investigations.</p>

<p>Mr Church, regarding the problem as one of “uniform growth,”
easily arrives at the conclusion that, <i>if</i> this growth can be conceived
as taking place symmetrically about a central point or “pole,”
the uniform growth would then manifest itself in logarithmic
spirals, including of course the limiting cases of the circle and
straight line. With this statement I have little fault to find; it
is in essence identical with much that I have said in a previous
chapter. But other statements of Mr Church’s, and many theories
woven about them by Sir T. Cook and himself, I am less able to
follow. Mr Church tells us that the essential phenomenon in the
sunflower disc is a series of orthogonally intersecting logarithmic
spirals. Unless I wholly misapprehend Mr Church’s meaning, I
should say that this is very far from
essential. The spirals <span class="xxpn" id="p640">{640}</span>
intersect isogonally, but orthogonal intersection would be only
one particular case, and in all probability a very infrequent one,
in the intersection of logarithmic spirals developed about a
common pole. Again on the analogy of the hydrodynamic lines
of force in certain vortex movements, and of similar lines of
force in certain magnetic phenomena, Mr Church proceeds to
argue that the energies of life follow lines comparable to those of
electric energy, and that the logarithmic spirals of the sunflower
are, so to speak, lines of equipotential<a class="afnanch" href="#fn576" id="fnanch576">576</a>.
And Sir T. Cook
remarks that this “theory, if correct, would be fundamental for
all forms of growth, though it would be more easily observed in
plant construction than in animals.” The parallel I am not able
to follow.</p>

<p>Mr Church sees in phyllotaxis an organic mystery, a something
for which we are unable to suggest any precise cause: a phenomenon
which is to be referred, somehow, to waves of growth emanating
from a centre, but on the other hand not to be explained by the
division of an apical cell, or any other histological factor. As
Sir T. Cook puts it, “at the growing point of a plant where the
new members are being formed, there is simply <i>nothing to see</i>.”</p>

<p>But it is impossible to deal satisfactorily, in brief space, either
with Mr Church’s theories, or my own objections to them<a class="afnanch" href="#fn577" id="fnanch577">577</a>.
Let
it suffice to say that I, for my part, see no subtle mystery in the
matter, other than what lies in the steady production of similar
growing parts, similarly situated, at similar successive intervals
of time. If such be the case, then we are
bound to have in <span class="xxpn" id="p641">{641}</span>
consequence a series of symmetrical patterns, whose nature will
depend upon the form of the entire surface. If the surface be
that of a cylinder we shall have a system, or systems, of spiral
helices: if it be a plane, with an infinitely distant focus, such as
we obtain by “unwrapping” our cylindrical surface, we shall
have straight lines; if it be a plane containing the focus within
itself, or if it be any other symmetrical surface containing the
focus, then we shall have a system of logarithmic spirals. The
appearance of these spirals is sometimes spoken of as a “subjective”
phenomenon, but the description is inaccurate: it is a purely
math­e­mat­i­cal phenomenon, an inseparable secondary result of
other arrangements which we, for the time being, regard as primary.
When the bricklayer builds a factory chimney, he lays his bricks
in a certain steady, orderly way, with no thought of the spiral
patterns to which this orderly sequence inevitably leads, and which
spiral patterns are by no means “subjective.” The designer of
a wall-paper not only has no intention of producing a pattern
of criss-cross lines, but on the contrary he does his best to avoid
them; nevertheless, so long as his design is a symmetrical one,
the criss-cross intersections inevitably come.</p>

<p>Let us, however, leave this discussion, and return to the facts
of the case.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Our second question, which relates to the numerical coincidences
so familiar to all students of phyllotaxis, is not to be set and
answered in a word.</p>

<p>Let us, for simplicity’s sake, avoid consideration of simultaneous
or whorled leaf origins, and consider only the more frequent
cases where a single “genetic spiral” can be traced throughout
the entire system.</p>

<p>It is seldom that this primary, genetic spiral catches the eye,
for the leaves which immediately succeed one another in this
genetic order are usually far apart on the circumference of the
stem, and it is only in close-packed arrangements that the eye
readily apprehends the continuous series. Accordingly in such
a case as a fir-cone, for instance, it is certain of the secondary
spirals or “parastichies” which catch the eye; and among
fir-cones, we can easily count these, and we find
them to be <span class="xxpn" id="p642">{642}</span>
on the whole very constant in number, according to the
species.</p>

<p>Thus in many cones, such as those of the Norway spruce, we
can trace five rows of scales winding steeply up the cone in one
direction, and three rows winding less steeply the other way; in
certain other species, such as the common larch, the normal
number is eight rows in the one direction and five in the other;
while in the American larch we have again three in the one direction
and five in the other. It not seldom happens that two arrangements
grade into one another on different parts of one and the
same cone. Among other cases in which such spiral series are
readily visible we have, for instance, the crowded leaves of the
stone-crops and mesembryanthemums, and (as we have said) the
crowded florets of the composites. Among these we may find
plenty of examples in which the numbers of the serial rows are
similar to those of the fir-cones; but in some cases, as in the daisy
and others of the smaller composites, we shall be able to trace
thirteen rows in one direction and twenty-one in the other, or
perhaps twenty-one and thirty-four; while in a great big sunflower
we may find (in one and the same species) thirty-four and fifty-five,
fifty-five and eighty-nine, or even as many as eighty-nine and
one hundred and forty-four. On the other hand, in an ordinary
“pentamerous” flower, such as a ranunculus, we may be able to
trace, in the arrangement of its sepals, petals and stamens, shorter
spiral series, three in one direction and two in the other. It will
be at once observed that these arrangements manifest themselves
in connection with very different things, in the orderly interspacing
of single leaves and of entire florets, and among all kinds of leaf-like
structures, foliage-leaves, bracts, cone-scales, and the various
parts or members of the flower. Again we must be careful to
note that, while the above numerical characters are by much the
most common, so much so as to be deemed “normal,” many
other combinations are known to occur.</p>

<p>The arrangement, as we have seen, is apt to vary when the
entire structure varies greatly in size, as in the disc of the sunflower.
It is also subject to less regular variation within one and
the same species, as can always be discovered when we examine
a sufficiently large sample of fir-cones. For instance,
out of 505 <span class="xxpn" id="p643">{643}</span>
cones of the Norway spruce, Beal<a class="afnanch" href="#fn578" id="fnanch578">578</a>
found 92 per cent. in which
the spirals were in five and eight rows; in 6 per cent. the rows
were four and seven, and in 4 per cent. they were four and six.
In each case they were nearly equally divided as regards direction;
for instance of the 467 cones shewing the five-eight arrangement,
the five-series ran in right-handed spirals in 224 cases, and in
left-handed spirals in 243.</p>

<p>Omitting the “abnormal” cases, such as we have seen to occur
in a small percentage of our cones of the spruce, the arrangements
which we have just mentioned may be set forth as follows, (the
fractional number used being simply an abbreviated symbol for
the number of associated helices or parastichies which we can
count running in the opposite directions):
2&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;3,
&#x2008;3&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;5,
&#x2008;5&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;8,
&#x2008;8&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;13,
&#x2008;13&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;21,
&#x2008;21&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;34,
&#x2008;34&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;55,
&#x2008;55&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;89,
&#x2008;89&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;144. Now these num­bers form a
very in­ter­est­ing series, which happens to have a num­ber of curious
math­e­mat­i­cal pro­per­ties<a class="afnanch" href="#fn579" id="fnanch579">579</a>.
We see, for instance, that the de­nom­i­na­tor
of each fraction is the num­er­a­tor of the next; and further,
that each suc­ces­sive numerator, or denominator, is the sum of
the preceding two. Our immediate problem, then, is to determine,
if possible, how these numerical coincidences come about, and
why these particular numbers should be so
commonly met with <span class="xxpn" id="p644">{644}</span>
as to be considered “normal” and char­ac­ter­is­tic features of the
general phenomenon of phyllotaxis. The following account is
based on a short paper by Professor P. G. Tait<a class="afnanch" href="#fn580" id="fnanch580">580</a>.</p>

<div class="dleft dwth-d" id="fig325">
<img src="images/i644.png" width="384" height="255" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 325.</div></div>

<p>Of the two following diagrams, Fig. <a href="#fig325" title="go to Fig. 325">325</a> represents the
general case, and Fig. <a href="#fig326" title="go to Fig. 326">326</a> a particular one, for the sake
of possibly greater simplicity. Both diagrams represent a
portion of a branch, or fir-cone, regarded as cylindrical,
and unwrapped to form a plane surface. <i>A</i>, <i>a</i>, at the two
ends of the base-line, represent the same initial leaf or
scale: <i>O</i> is a leaf which can be reached from <i>A</i> by <i>m</i>
steps in a right-hand spiral (developed into the straight
line <i>AO</i>), and by <i>n</i> steps from <i>a</i> in a left-handed
spiral <i>aO</i>. Now it is obvious in our fir-cone, that we can
include <i>all</i> the scales upon the cone by taking so many
spirals in the one direction, and again include them all
by so many in the other. Accordingly, in our diagrammatic
construction, the spirals <i>AO</i> and <i>aO</i> <i>must</i>, and always
<i>can</i>, be so taken that <i>m</i> spirals parallel to <i>aO</i>, and
<i>n</i> spirals parallel to <i>AO</i>, shall separately include all
the leaves upon the stem or cone. <br class="brclrfix"
/></p>

<p>If <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> have a common factor, <i>l</i>, it can easily be shewn that
the arrangement is composite, and that there are <i>l</i> fundamental,
or genetic spirals, and <i>l</i> leaves (including <i>A</i>) which are situated
exactly on the line <i>Aa</i>. That is to say, we have here a <i>whorled</i>
arrangement, which we have agreed to leave unconsidered in
favour of the simpler case. We restrict ourselves, accordingly,
to the cases where there is but one genetic spiral, and when
<i>therefore</i> <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> are prime to one another.</p>

<p>Our fundamental, or genetic, spiral, as we have seen, is that
which passes from <i>A</i> (or <i>a</i>) to the leaf which is situated nearest to
the base-line <i>Aa</i>. The fundamental spiral will thus be right-handed
(<i>A</i>, <i>P</i>, etc.) if <i>P</i>, which is nearer to <i>A</i> than to <i>a</i>, be this
leaf—left-handed if it be <i>p</i>. That is to say, we make it a convention
that we shall always, for our fundamental
spiral, run <span class="xxpn" id="p645">{645}</span>
round the system, from one leaf to the next, <i>by the shortest
way</i>.</p>

<p>Now it is obvious, from the symmetry of the figure (as further
shewn in Fig. <a href="#fig326" title="go to Fig. 326">326</a>), that, besides the spirals running along <i>AO</i> and
<i>aO</i>, we have a series running <i>from the steps on</i> <i>aO</i> to the steps on
<i>AO</i>. In other words we can find a leaf (<i>S</i>) upon <i>AO</i>, which, like
the leaf <i>O</i>, is reached directly by a spiral series from <i>A</i> and from
<i>a</i>, such that <i>aS</i> includes <i>n</i> steps, and <i>AS</i> (being part of the old
spiral line <i>AO</i>) now includes
<span class="nowrap"><i>m−n</i></span></p>

<div class="dctr03" id="fig326">
<img src="images/i645.png" width="608" height="678" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 326.</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">
steps. And, since <i>m</i> and <i>n</i>
are prime to one another (for otherwise the system would have
been a composite or whorled one), it is evident that we can
continue this process of convergence until we come down to a
<span class="nowrap">1, 1</span>
arrangement, that is to say to a leaf which is reached by a
single step, in opposite directions from <i>A</i> and from <i>a</i>, which leaf
is therefore the first leaf, next to <i>A</i>, of the fundamental or
generating spiral. <span class="xxpn" id="p646">{646}</span></p>

<p>If our original lines along <i>AO</i> and <i>aO</i> contain,
for instance, 13 and 8 steps respectively (i.e. <i>m</i>
<span class="nowrap">=&#x202f;13,</span> <i>n</i> <span
class="nowrap">=&#x202f;8),</span> then our next series,
observable in the same cone, will be 8 and <span
class="nowrap">(13&#x202f;−&#x202f;8)</span> or 5; the next 5
and <span class="nowrap">(8&#x202f;−&#x202f;5)</span> or 3;
the next <span class="nowrap">3, 2;</span> and the next <span
class="nowrap">2, 1;</span> leading to the ultimate condition
of <span class="nowrap">1, 1.</span> These are the very series
which we have found to be common, or normal; and so far as our
in­ves­ti­ga­tion has yet gone, it has proved to us that, if one
of these exists, it entails, <i>ipso facto</i>, the presence of the
rest.</p>

<p>In following down our series, according to the above construction,
we have seen that at every step we have changed
direction, the longer and the shorter sides of our triangle changing
places every time. Let us stop for a moment, when we come to
the 1, 2 series, or <i>AT</i>, <i>aT</i> of Fig. <a href="#fig326" title="go to Fig. 326">326</a>. It is obvious that there is
nothing to prevent us making a new 1, 3 series if we please, by
continuing the generating spiral through three leaves, and connecting
the leaf so reached directly with our initial one. But in
the case represented in Fig. <a href="#fig326" title="go to Fig. 326">326</a>, it is obvious that these two
series (<i>A</i>, 1, 2, 3, etc., and <i>a</i>, 3, 6, etc.) will be running in the same
direction; i.e. they will both be right-handed, or both left-handed
spirals. The simple meaning of this is that the third leaf of the
generating spiral was distant from our initial leaf by <i>more than the
circumference</i> of the cylindrical stem; in other words, that there
were more than two, but <i>less than three</i> leaves in a single turn of
the fundamental spiral.</p>

<p>Less than two there can obviously never be. When there are
exactly two, we have the simplest of all possible arrangements,
namely that in which the leaves are placed alternately on
opposite sides of the stem. When there are more than two, but
less than three, we have the elementary condition for the
production of the series which we have been considering, namely
<span class="nowrap">1, 2;</span> <span class="nowrap">2,
3;</span> <span class="nowrap">3, 5,</span> etc. To put
the latter part of this argument in more precise language,
let us say that: If, in our descending series, we come to
steps 1 and <i>t</i>, where <i>t</i> is determined by the condition
that 1 and <i>t</i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;1 would give spirals both
right-handed, or both left-handed; it follows that there are
less than <i>t</i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;1 leaves in a single turn of
the fundamental spiral. And, determined in this manner, it is
found in the great majority of cases, in fir-cones and a host
of other examples of phyllotaxis, that <i>t</i> =&#x202f;2. In other
words, in the <span class="xxpn" id="p647">{647}</span> great
majority of cases, we have what corresponds to an arrangement
next in order of simplicity to the simplest case of all: next,
that is to say, to the arrangement which consists of opposite
and alternate leaves.</p>

<p>“These simple con­si­de­ra­tions,” as Tait says, “explain
completely the so-called mysterious appearance of terms of the
recurring series 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, etc.<a class="afnanch"
href="#fn581" id="fnanch581">581</a> The other natural series,
usually but misleadingly represented by convergents to an
infinitely extended continuous fraction, are easily explained,
as above, by taking <i>t</i> =&#x202f;3, 4, 5, etc., etc.” Many
examples of these latter series have been given by Dickson&#xfeff;<a
class="afnanch" href="#fn582" id="fnanch582">582</a> and other
writers.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>We have now learned, among other elementary facts, that
wherever any one system of helical spirals is present, certain
others invariably and of necessity accompany it, and are definitely
related to it. In any diagram, such as Fig. <a href="#fig326" title="go to Fig. 326">326</a>, in which we
represent our leaf-arrangement by means of uniform and regularly
interspaced dots, we can draw one series of spirals after another,
and one as easily as another. But in our fir-cone, for instance,
one particular series, or rather two conjugate series, are always
conspicuous, while the others are sought and found with comparative
difficulty.</p>

<p>The phenomenon is illustrated by Fig. <a href="#fig327" title="go to Fig. 327">327</a>, <i>a</i>–<i>d</i>. The ground-plan
of all these diagrams is identically the same. The generating
spiral in each case represents a divergence of 3&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;8, or 135° of
azimuth; and the points succeed one another at the same successional
distances parallel to the axis. The rectangular outlines,
which correspond to the exposed surface of the leaves or cone-scales,
are of equal area, and of equal number. Nevertheless
the appearances presented by these diagrams are very different;
for in one the eye catches a 5&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;8 arrangement, in another a 3&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;5;
and so on, down to an arrangement of 1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;1. The math­e­mat­i­cal
side of this very curious phenomenon I have not attempted to
in­ves­ti­gate. But it is quite obvious that,
in a system within <span class="xxpn" id="p648">{648}</span>
which various spirals are implicitly contained, the conspicuousness
of one set or another does not depend upon angular divergence.
It depends on the</p>

 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 327.</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">
relative proportions in length and breadth of
the leaves themselves; or, more strictly speaking, on the ratio of
the diagonals of the rhomboidal figure by which each leaf-area is
circumscribed. When, as in the fir-cone, the scales by mutual
compression conform to these rhomboidal outlines, their inclined
edges at once guide the eye in the direction of some one particular
spiral; and we shall not fail to notice that in such
cases the usual <span class="xxpn" id="p649">{649}</span>
result is to give us arrangements cor­re­spon­ding to the middle
diagrams in Fig. <a href="#fig327" title="go to Fig. 327">327</a>, which are the con­fi­gur­a­tions in which the
quadrilateral outlines approach most nearly to a rectangular
form, and give us accordingly the least possible ratio (under the
given conditions) of sectional boundary-wall to surface area.</p>

<p>The manner in which one system of spirals may be caused
to slide, so to speak, into another, has been ingeniously
demonstrated by Schwendener on a mechanical model,
consisting essentially of a framework which can be opened
or closed to correspond with one after another of the
above series of diagrams<a class="afnanch" href="#fn583"
id="fnanch583">583</a>.</p>

<p>The determination of the precise angle of divergence
of two consecutive leaves of the generating spiral does
not enter into the above general in­ves­ti­ga­tion (though
Tait gives, in the same paper, a method by which it may
be easily determined); and the very fact that it does
not so enter shews it to be essentially unimportant. The
determination of so-called “orthostichies,” or precisely
vertical successions of leaves, is also unimportant. We
have no means, other than observation, of determining that
one leaf is vertically above another, and spiral series
such as we have been dealing with will appear, whether
such orthostichies exist, whether they be near or remote,
or whether the angle of divergence be such that no precise
vertical superposition ever occurs. And lastly, the fact
that the successional numbers, expressed as fractions,
1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;2, 2&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;3,
3&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;5, represent a convergent series,
whose final term is equal to 0·61803..., the <i>sectio aurea</i>
or “golden mean” of unity, is seen to be a math­e­mat­i­cal
coincidence, devoid of biological significance; it is
but a particular case of Lagrange’s theorem that the
roots of every numerical equation of the second degree
can be expressed by a periodic continued fraction. The
same number has a multitude of curious arithmetical
properties. It is the final term of all similar series to
that with which we have been dealing, such for instance
as 1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;3, 3&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;4,
4&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;7, etc., or
1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;4, 4&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;5,
5&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;9, etc. It is a number beloved
of the circle-squarer, and of all those who seek to
find, and then to penetrate, the secrets of the Great
Pyramid. It is deep-set in Pythagorean as well as in
Euclidean geometry. It enters (as the chord of an angle
of 36°), <span class="xxpn" id="p650">{650}</span> into
the thrice-isosceles triangle of which we have spoken on
p. <a href="#p511" title="go to pg. 511">511</a>; it is a number which becomes (by the addition of
unity) its own reciprocal; its properties never end. To
Kepler (as Naber tells us) it was a symbol of Creation,
or Generation. Its recent application to biology and
art-criticism by Sir Theodore Cook and others is not new.
Naber’s book, already quoted, is full of it. Zeising,
in 1854, found in it the key to all morphology, and the
same writer, later on<a class="afnanch" href="#fn584"
id="fnanch584">584</a>, declared it to dominate both
architecture and music. But indeed, to use Sir Thomas
Browne’s words (though it was of another number that
he spoke): “To enlarge this contemplation into all the
mysteries and secrets accommodable unto this number, were
inexcusable Pythagorisme.”</p>

<p>If this number has any serious claim at all to enter into
the biological question of phyllotaxis, this must depend on the
fact, first emphasized by Chauncey Wright<a class="afnanch"
href="#fn585" id="fnanch585">585</a>, that, if the successive
leaves of the fundamental spiral be placed at the particular
azimuth which divides the circle in this “sectio aurea,”
then no two leaves will ever be superposed; and thus we are
said to have “the most thorough and rapid distribution of
the leaves round the stem, each new or higher leaf falling
over the angular space between the two older ones which are
nearest in direction, so as to divide it in the same ratio
(<i>K</i>), in which the first two or any two successive ones divide
the circumference. Now 5&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;8 and all
successive fractions differ inappreciably from <i>K</i>.” To this
view there are many simple objections. In the first place,
even 5&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;8, or ·625, is but a moderately
close approximation to the “golden mean”; in the second place
the arrangements by which a better approximation is got, such
as 8&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;13, 13&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;21,
and the very close approximations such as
34&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;55, 55&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;89,
89&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;144, etc., are comparatively
rare, while the much less close approximations of
3&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;5 or 2&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;3,
or even 1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;2, are extremely common.
Again, the general type of argument such as that which
asserts that the plant is “aiming at” something which we may
call an “ideal angle” is one that cannot commend itself to
a plain student of physical science: nor is the hypothesis
rendered more acceptably when Sir T. Cook qualifies it by
telling us that “all that a plant can do <span class="xxpn"
id="p651">{651}</span> is to vary, to make blind shots at
constructions, or to ‘mutate’ as it is now termed; and the
most suitable of these constructions will in the long run be
isolated by the action of Natural Selection.” Finally, and this
is the most concrete objection of all, the supposed isolation
of the leaves, or their most complete “distribution to the
action of the surrounding atmosphere” is manifestly very little
affected by any conditions which are confined to the angle of
azimuth. If we could imagine a case in which all the leaves of
the stem, or all the scales of a fir-cone, were crushed down to
one and the same level, into a simple ring or whorl of leaves,
then indeed they would have their most equable distribution
under the condition of the “ideal angle,” that is to say of
the “golden mean.” But if it be (so to speak) Nature’s object
to set them further apart than they actually are, to give them
freer exposure to the air than they actually have, then it is
surely manifest that the simple way to do so is to elongate the
axis, and to set the leaves further apart, lengthways on the
stem. This has at once a far more potent effect than any nice
manipulation of the “angle of divergence.” For it is obvious that in
<span class="nowrap"><i>F</i>(ϕ&#x202f;·&#x202f;sin&#x202f;θ)</span>
we have a greater range of variation by altering θ than by
altering ϕ. We come then, without more ado, to the conclusion
that the “Fibonacci series,” and its supposed usefulness, and
the hypothesis of its introduction into plant-structure through
natural selection, are all matters which deserve no place in
the plain study of botanical phenomena. As Sachs shrewdly
recognised years ago, all such speculations as these hark back
to a school of mystical idealism.</p>

 Hollow Structures.">CHAPTER XV
 <span class="h2ttl">ON THE SHAPES OF EGGS, AND OF CERTAIN OTHER
 HOLLOW STRUCTURES</span></h2></div>

<p>The eggs of birds and all other hard-shelled eggs, such as those
of the tortoise and the crocodile, are simple solids of revolution;
but they differ greatly in form, according to the configuration of
the plane curve by the revolution of which the egg is, in a math­e­mat­i­cal
sense, generated. Some few eggs, such as those of the
owl, the penguin, or the tortoise, are spherical or very nearly so; a
few more, such as the grebe’s, the cormorant’s or the pelican’s, are
ap­prox­i­mate­ly ellipsoidal, with symmetrical or nearly symmetrical
ends, and somewhat similar are the so-called “cylindrical” eggs
of the megapodes and the sand-grouse; the great majority, like
the hen’s egg, are ovoid, a little blunter at one end than the other;
and some, by an exaggeration of this lack of antero-posterior
symmetry, are blunt at one end but char­ac­teris­ti­cally pointed at
the other, as is the case with the eggs of the guillemot and puffin,
the sandpiper, plover and curlew. It is an obvious but by no
means negligible fact that the egg, while often pointed, is never
flattened or discoidal; it is a prolate, but never an oblate, spheroid.</p>

<p>The careful study and collection of birds’ eggs would seem to
have begun with the Count de Marsigli<a class="afnanch" href="#fn586" id="fnanch586">586</a>,
the same celebrated
naturalist who first studied the “flowers” of the coral, and who
wrote the <i>Histoire physique de la mer</i>; and the specific form, as
well as the colour and other attributes of the egg have been
again and again discussed, and not least by the many dilettanti
naturalists of the eighteenth century who soon followed in
Marsigli’s footsteps<a class="afnanch" href="#fn587" id="fnanch587">587</a>.
<span class="xxpn" id="p653">{653}</span></p>

<p>We need do no more than mention Aristotle’s belief, doubtless
old in his time, that the more pointed egg produces the male
chicken, and the blunter egg the hen; though this theory survived
into modern times<a class="afnanch" href="#fn588" id="fnanch588">588</a>
and perhaps still lingers on. Several naturalists,
such as Günther (1772) and Bühle (1818), have taken the
trouble to disprove it by experiment. A more modern and more
generally accepted explanation has been that the form of the egg
is in direct relation to that of the bird which has to be hatched
within—a view that would seem to have been first set forth by
Naumann and Bühle, in their great treatise on eggs<a class="afnanch" href="#fn589" id="fnanch589">589</a>,
and adopted
by Des Murs<a class="afnanch" href="#fn590" id="fnanch590">590</a>
and many other well-known writers.</p>

<p>In a treatise by de Lafresnaye<a class="afnanch" href="#fn591" id="fnanch591">591</a>,
an elaborate comparison is
made between the skeleton and the egg of the various birds, to
shew, for instance, how those birds with a deep-keeled sternum
laid rounded eggs, which alone could accommodate the form of the
young. According to this view, that “Nature had foreseen<a class="afnanch" href="#fn592" id="fnanch592">592</a>”
the form adapted to and necessary for the growing embryo, it
was easy to correlate the owl with its spherical egg, the diver
with its elliptical one, and in like manner the round egg of the
tortoise and the elongated one of the crocodile with the shape of
the creatures which had afterwards to be hatched therein. A few
writers, such as Thienemann<a class="afnanch" href="#fn593" id="fnanch593">593</a>,
looked at the same facts the other
way, and asserted that the form of the egg was determined by
that of the bird by which it was laid, and in whose body it had
been conformed.</p>

<p>In more recent times, other theories, based upon the principles
of Natural Selection, have been current and very generally accepted,
to account for these diversities of form. The pointed, conical
egg of the guillemot is generally supposed
to be an adaptation, <span class="xxpn" id="p654">{654}</span>
advantageous to the species in the circumstances under which
the egg is laid; the pointed egg is less apt than a spherical one to
roll off the narrow ledge of rock on which this bird is said to lay
its solitary egg, and the more pointed the egg, so much the fitter
and likelier is it to survive. The fact that the plover or the
sandpiper, breeding in very different situations, lay eggs that are
also conical, elicits another explanation, to the effect that here
the conical form permits the many large eggs to be packed closely
under the mother bird<a class="afnanch" href="#fn594" id="fnanch594">594</a>.
Whatever truth there be in these apparent
adaptations to existing circumstances, it is only by a very hasty
logic that we can accept them as a <i>vera causa</i>, or adequate
explanation of the facts; and it is obvious that, in the bird’s egg,
we have an admirable case for the direct in­ves­ti­ga­tion of the
mechanical or physical significance of its form<a class="afnanch" href="#fn595" id="fnanch595">595</a>.</p>

<p>Of all the many naturalists of the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries who wrote on the subject of eggs, one alone (so far as
I am aware) ascribed the form of the egg to direct mechanical
causes. Günther<a class="afnanch" href="#fn596" id="fnanch596">596</a>,
in 1772, declared that the more or less rounded
or pointed form of the egg is a mechanical consequence of the
pressure of the oviduct at a time when the shell is yet unformed
or unsolidified; and that accordingly, to explain the round egg of
the owl or the kingfisher, we have only to admit that the oviduct
of these birds is somewhat larger than that of most others, or
less subject to violent contractions. This statement contains, in
essence, the whole story of the mechanical conformation of the egg.</p>

<p>Let us consider, very briefly, the conditions to which the egg
is subject in its passage down the oviduct<a class="afnanch" href="#fn597" id="fnanch597">597</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(1) The “egg,” as it enters the oviduct, consists of the yolk
only, enclosed in its vitelline membrane. As it passes down the
first portion of the oviduct, the white is
gradually superadded, <span class="xxpn" id="p655">{655}</span>
and becomes in turn surrounded by the “shell-membrane.”
About this latter the shell is secreted, rapidly and at a late period;
the egg having meanwhile passed on into a wider portion of the
oviducal tube, called (by loose analogy, as Owen says) the “uterus.”
Here the egg assumes its permanent form, here it becomes rigid,
and it is to this portion of the “oviduct” that our argument
principally refers.</p></li>

<li><p>(2) Both the yolk and the entire egg tend to fill completely
their respective membranes, and, whether this be due to growth
or imbibition on the part of the contents or to contraction on the
part of the surrounding membranes, the resulting tendency is for
both yolk and egg to be, in the first instance, spherical, unless
otherwise distorted by external pressure.</p></li>

<li><p>(3) The egg is subject to pressure within the oviduct, which
is an elastic, muscular tube, along the walls of which pass peristaltic
waves of contraction. These muscular contractions may
be described as the contraction of successive annuli of muscle,
giving annular (or radial) pressure to successive portions of the
egg; they drive the egg forward against the frictional resistance
of the tube, while tending at the same time to distort its form.
While nothing is known, so far as I am aware, of the muscular
physiology of the oviduct, it is well known in the case of the
intestine that the presence of an obstruction leads to the development
of violent contractions in its rear, which waves of contraction
die away, and are scarcely if at all propagated in advance of the
obstruction.</p></li>

<li><p>(4) It is known by observation that a hen’s egg is always
laid blunt end foremost.</p></li>

<li><p>(5) It can be shown, at least as a very common rule, that
those eggs which are most unsymmetrical, or most tapered off
posteriorly, are also eggs of a large size relatively to the parent
bird. The guillemot is a notable case in point, and so also are
the curlews, sandpipers, phaleropes and terns. We may accordingly
presume that the more pointed eggs are those that are large
relatively to the tube or oviduct through which they have to pass,
or, in other words, are those which are subject to the greatest
pressure while being forced along. So general is this relation
that we may go still further, and presume
with great plausibility <span class="xxpn" id="p656">{656}</span>
in the few exceptional cases (of which the apteryx is the most
conspicuous) where the egg is relatively large though not markedly
unsymmetrical, that in these cases the oviduct itself is in all
probability large (as Günther had suggested) in proportion to the
size of the bird. In the case of the common fowl we can trace a
direct relation between the size and shape of the egg, for the first
eggs laid by a young pullet are usually smaller, and at the same
time are much more nearly spherical than the later ones; and,
moreover, some breeds of fowls lay proportionately smaller eggs
than others, and on the whole the former eggs tend to be rounder
than the latter<a class="afnanch" href="#fn598" id="fnanch598">598</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>We may now proceed to inquire more particularly how the form
of the egg is controlled by the pressures to which it is subjected.</p>

<p>The egg, just prior to the formation of the shell, is, as we have
seen, a fluid body, tending to a spherical shape and <i>enclosed within
a membrane</i>.</p>

<p>Our problem, then, is: Given a practically incompressible
fluid, contained in a deformable capsule, which is either (<i>a</i>) entirely
inextensible, or (<i>b</i>) slightly extensible, and which is placed in a
long elastic tube the walls of which are radially contractile, to
determine the shape under pressure.</p>

<p>If the capsule be spherical, inextensible, and completely filled
with the fluid, absolutely no deformation can take place. The
few eggs that are actually or ap­prox­i­mate­ly spherical, such as
those of the tortoise or the owl, may thus be alternatively explained
as cases where little or no deforming pressure has been applied
prior to the solidification of the shell, or else as cases where the
capsule was so little capable of extension and so completely filled
as to preclude the possibility of deformation.</p>

<p>If the capsule be not spherical, but be inextensible, then
deformation can take place under the external
radial compression, <span class="xxpn" id="p657">{657}</span>
only provided that the pressure tends to make the shape more
nearly spherical, and then only on the further supposition that
the capsule is also not entirely filled as the deformation proceeds.
In other words, an incompressible fluid contained in an inextensible
envelope cannot be deformed without puckering of the
envelope taking place.</p>

<p>Let us next assume, as the conditions by which this result
may be avoided, (<i>a</i>) that the envelope is to some extent extensible,
or (<i>b</i>) that the whole structure grows under relatively fixed
conditions. The two suppositions are practically identical with
one another in effect. It is obvious that, on the presumption
that the envelope is only moderately extensible, the whole structure
can only be distorted to a moderate degree away from the spherical
or spheroidal form.</p>

<p>At all points the shape is determined by the law of the
distribution of <i>radial pressure within the given region of the tube</i>,
surface friction helping to maintain the egg in position. If
the egg be under pressure from the oviduct, but without any
marked component either in a forward or backward direction,
the egg will be compressed in the middle, and will tend more or
less to the form of a cylinder with spherical ends. The eggs of
the grebe, cormorant, or crocodile may be supposed to receive
their shape in such circumstances.</p>

<p>When the egg is subject to the peristaltic contraction of the
oviduct during its formation, then from the nature and direction
of motion of the peristaltic wave the pressure will be greatest
somewhere behind the middle of the egg; in other words, the tube
is converted for the time being into a more conical form, and the
simple result follows that the anterior end of the egg becomes the
broader and the posterior end the narrower.</p>

<p>With a given shape and size of body, equi­lib­rium in the tube
may be maintained under greater radial pressure towards one end
than towards the other. For example, a cylinder having conical
ends, of semi-angles θ and θ&#xfeff;′ respectively, remains in equi­lib­rium,
apart from friction, if <i>p</i>&#xfeff;cos&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup>&#x202f;θ
=&#x202f;<i>p&#xfeff;′</i>&#xfeff;cos&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup>&#x202f;θ&#xfeff;′, so that at the more
tapered end where θ is small <i>p</i> is small. Therefore the whole
structure might assume such a configuration, or grow under such
conditions, finally becoming rigid by solidification
of the envelope. <span class="xxpn" id="p658">{658}</span>
According to the preceding paragraph, we must assume some
initial distribution of pressure, some squeeze applied to the
posterior part of the egg, in order to give it its tapering form. But,
that form once acquired, the egg may remain in equi­lib­rium both
as regards form and position within the tube, even after that
excess of pressure on the posterior part is relieved. Moreover,
the above equation shews that a normal pressure no greater and
(within certain limits) actually less acting upon the posterior part
than on the anterior part of the egg after the shell is formed will
be sufficient to communicate to it a forward motion. This is an
important consideration, for it shews that the ordinary form of
an egg, and even the conical form of an extreme case such as the
guillemot’s, is directly favourable to the movement of the egg
within the oviduct, blunt end foremost.</p>

<p>The math­e­mat­i­cal statement of the whole case is as follows:
In our egg, consisting of an extensible membrane filled with an
incompressible fluid and under external pressure, the equation of
the envelope is <i>p&#xfeff;<sub>n</sub></i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;<i>T</i>(1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>r</i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>r&#xfeff;′</i>)
=&#x202f;<i>P</i>, where <i>p&#xfeff;<sub>n</sub></i> is the normal
component of external pressure at a point where <i>r</i> and <i>r&#xfeff;′</i> are the
radii of curvature, <i>T</i> is the tension of the envelope, and <i>P</i> the
internal fluid pressure. This is simply the equation of an elastic
surface where <i>T</i> represents the coefficient of elasticity; in other
words, a flexible elastic shell has the same math­e­mat­i­cal properties
as our fluid, membrane-covered egg. And this is the identical
equation which we have already had so frequent occasion to employ
in our discussion of the forms of cells; save only that in these
latter we had chiefly to study the tension <i>T</i> (i.e. the surface-tension
of the semi-fluid cell) and had little or nothing to do with the
factor of external pressure (<i>p&#xfeff;<sub>n</sub></i>), which in the case of the egg becomes
of chief importance.</p>

<p>The above equation is the <i>equation of equi­lib­rium</i>, so that it
must be assumed either that the whole body is at rest or that its
motion while under pressure is not such as to affect the result.
Tangential forces, which have been neglected, could modify the
form by alteration of <i>T</i>. In our case we must, and may very
reasonably, assume that any movement of the egg down the
oviduct during the period when its form is being impressed upon
it is very slow, being possibly balanced by the
advance of the <span class="xxpn" id="p659">{659}</span>
peristaltic wave which causes the movement, as well as by
friction.</p>

<p>The quantity <i>T</i> is the tension of the enclosing capsule—the
surrounding membrane. If <i>T</i> be constant or symmetrical about
the axis of the body, the body is symmetrical. But the abnormal
eggs that a hen sometimes lays, cylindrical, annulated, or quite
irregular, are due to local weakening of the membrane, in other
words, to asymmetry of <i>T</i>. Not only asymmetry of <i>T</i>, but also
asymmetry of <i>p&#xfeff;<sub>n</sub></i>, will render the body subject to deformation,
and this factor, the unknown but regularly varying, largely
radial, pressure applied by successive annuli of the oviduct, is the
essential cause of the form, and variations of form, of the egg.
In fact, in so far as the postulates correspond near enough to
actualities, the above equation is the equation of <i>all eggs</i> in the
universe. At least this is so if we generalise it in the form
<i>p&#xfeff;<sub>n</sub></i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;<i>T&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;r</i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;<i>T&#xfeff;′&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;r&#xfeff;′</i>
=&#x202f;<i>P</i> in recognition of a possible difference between
the principal tensions.</p>

<p>In the case of the spherical egg it is obvious that <i>p&#xfeff;<sub>n</sub></i> is everywhere
equal. The simplest case is where <i>p&#xfeff;<sub>n</sub></i>
=&#x202f;0, in other words,
where the egg is so small as practically to escape deforming
pressure from the tube. But we may also conceive the tube to
be so thin-walled and extensible as to press with practically
equal force upon all parts of the contained sphere. If while our
egg be in process of conformation the envelope be free at any
part from external pressure (that is to say, if <i>p&#xfeff;<sub>n</sub></i>
=&#x202f;0), then it is
obvious that that part (if of circular section) will be a portion of
a sphere. This is not unlikely to be the case actually or ap­prox­i­mate­ly
at one or both poles of the egg, and is evidently the case
over a considerable portion of the anterior end of the plover’s
egg.</p>

<p>In the case of the conical egg with spherical ends, as is more
or less the case in the plover’s and the guillemot’s, then at either
end of the egg <i>r</i> and <i>r&#xfeff;′</i> are identical, and they are greater at the
blunt anterior end than at the other. If we may assume that <i>p&#xfeff;<sub>n</sub></i>
vanishes at the poles of the egg, then it is plain that <i>T</i> varies in
the neighbourhood of these poles, and, further, that the tension
<i>T</i> is greatest at and near the small end of the egg. It is here,
in short, that the egg is most likely to be
irregularly distorted or <span class="xxpn" id="p660">{660}</span>
even to burst, and it is here that we most commonly find irregularities
of shape in abnormal eggs.</p>

<p>If one portion of the envelope were to become practically stiff
before <i>p</i> ceases to vary, that would be tantamount to a sudden
variation of <i>T</i>, and would introduce asymmetry by the imposition
of a boundary condition in addition to the above equation.</p>

<p>Within the egg lies the yolk, and the yolk is invariably spherical
or very nearly so, whatever be the form of the entire egg. The
reason is simple, and lies in the fact that the yolk is itself enclosed
in another membrane, between which and the outer membrane
lies a fluid the presence of which makes <i>p&#xfeff;<sub>n</sub></i> for the inner membrane
practically constant. The smallness of friction is indicated by
the well-known fact that the “germinal spot” on the surface of
the yolk is always found uppermost, however we may place and
wherever we may open the egg; that is to say, the yolk easily
rotates within the egg, bringing its lighter pole uppermost. So,
owing to this lack of friction in the outer fluid, or white, whatever
shear is produced within the egg will not be easily transmitted
to the yolk, and, moreover, owing to the same fluidity, the yolk
will easily recover its normal sphericity after the egg-shell is
formed and the unequal pressure relieved.</p>

<p>These, then, are the general principles involved in, and illustrated
by, the configuration of an egg; and they take us as far
as we can safely go without actual quantitative determinations,
in each particular case, of the forces concerned.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>In certain cases among the invertebrates, we again find
instances of hard-shelled eggs which have obviously been
moulded by the oviduct, or so-called “ootype,” in which they
have lain: and not merely in such a way as to shew the effects
of peristaltic pressure upon a uniform elastic envelope, but so
as to impress upon the egg the more or less irregular form
of the cavity, within which it had been for a time contained
and compressed. After this fashion Dr
Looss<a class="afnanch" href="#fn599" id="fnanch599">599</a>
of Cairo has <span class="xxpn" id="p661">{661}</span>
explained the curious form of the egg in <i>Bilharzia</i> (<i>Schistosoma</i>)
<i>haematobium</i>, a formidable parasitic worm to which is due a disease
wide-spread in Africa and Arabia, and an especial scourge of the
Mecca pilgrims. The egg in this worm is provided at one end
with a little spine, which now and then is found to be placed not
terminally but laterally or ventrally, and which when so placed
has been looked upon as the mark of a supposed new species,
<i>S. Mansoni</i>. As Looss has now shewn, the little spine must be
explained as having been moulded within a little funnel-shaped
expansion of the uterus, just where it communicates with the
common duct leading from the ovary and yolk-gland; by the
accumulation of eggs in the ootype, the one last formed is crowded
into a sideways position, and then, where the side-wall of the egg
bulges in the funnel-shaped orifice of the duct, a little lateral
“spine” is formed. In another species, <i>S. japonicum</i>, the egg is
described as bulging into a so-called “calotte,” or bubble-like
convexity at the end opposite to the spine. This, I think, may,
with very little doubt, be ascribed to hardening of the egg-shell
having taken place just at the period when partial relief from
pressure was being experienced by the egg in the neighbourhood
of the dilated orifice of the oviduct.</p>

<p>This case of Bilharzia is not, from our present point of view, a
very important one, but nevertheless it is interesting. It ascribes
to a mechanical cause a curious peculiarity of form; it shews, by
reference to this mechanical principle, that two conditions which
were very different to the systematic naturalist’s eye, were really
only two simple mechanical modifications of the same thing;
and it destroys the chief evidence for the existence of a supposed
new species of worm, a continued belief in which, among worms
of such great pathogenic importance, might lead to gravely
erroneous pathological deductions.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3><i>On the Form of Sea-urchins</i></h3></div>

<p>As a corollary to the problem of the bird’s egg, we may consider
for a moment the forms assumed by the shells of the sea-urchins.
These latter are commonly divided into two classes, the Regular
and the Irregular Echinids. The regular
sea-urchins, save in <span class="xxpn" id="p662">{662}</span>
slight details which do not affect our problem, have a complete
radial symmetry. The axis of the animal’s body is vertical,
with mouth below and the intestinal outlet above; and around
this axis the shell is built as a symmetrical system. It follows
that in horizontal section the shell is everywhere circular, and we
shall have only to consider its form as seen in vertical section or
projection. The irregular urchins (very inaccurately so-called)
have the anal extremity of the body removed from its central,
dorsal situation; and it follows that they have now a single plane
of symmetry, about which the organism, shell and all, is bilaterally
symmetrical. We need not concern ourselves in detail with the
shapes of their shells, which may be very simply interpreted, by
the help of radial co-ordinates, as deformations of the circular or
“regular” type.</p>

<p>The sea-urchin shell consists of a membrane, stiffened into
rigidity by calcareous deposits, which constitute a beautiful
skeleton of separate, neatly fitting “ossicles.” The rigidity of
the shell is more apparent than real, for the entire structure is,
in a sluggish way, plastic; inasmuch as each little ossicle is
capable of growth, and the entire shell grows by increments to
each and all of these multitudinous elements, whose individual
growth involves a certain amount of freedom to move relatively
to one another; in a few cases the ossicles are so little developed
that the whole shell appears soft and flexible. The viscera of the
animal occupy but a small part of the space within the shell, the
cavity being mainly filled by a large quantity of watery fluid,
whose density must be very near to that of the external sea-water.</p>

<p>Apart from the fact that the sea-urchin continues to grow, it
is plain that we have here the same general conditions as in the
egg-shell, and that the form of the sea-urchin is subject to a similar
equi­lib­rium of forces. But there is this important difference, that
an external muscular pressure (such as the oviduct administers
during the consolidation of egg-shell), is now lacking. In its
place we have the steady continuous influence of gravity, and
there is yet another force which in all probability we require to
take into consideration.</p>

<p>While the sea-urchin is alive, an immense number of delicate
“tube-feet,” with suckers at their tips, pass
through minute pores <span class="xxpn" id="p663">{663}</span>
in the shell, and, like so many long cables, moor the animal to
the ground. They constitute a symmetrical system of forces,
with one resultant downwards, in the direction of gravity, and
another outwards in a radial direction; and if we look upon the
shell as originally spherical, both will tend to depress the sphere
into a flattened cake. We need not consider the radial component,
but may treat the case as that of a spherical shell symmetrically
depressed under the influence of gravity. This is precisely the
condition which we have to deal with in a drop of liquid lying on
a plate; the form of which is determined by its own uniform
surface-tension, plus gravity, acting against the uniform internal
hydrostatic pressure. Simple as this system is, the full math­e­mat­i­cal
in­ves­ti­ga­tion of the form of a drop is not easy, and we
can scarcely hope that the systematic study of the Echinodermata
will ever be conducted by methods based on Laplace’s differential
equation<a class="afnanch" href="#fn600" id="fnanch600">600</a>;
but we have no difficulty in seeing that the various
forms represented in a series of sea-urchin shells are no other than
those which we may easily and perfectly imitate in drops.</p>

<p>In the case of the drop of water (or of any other particular
liquid) the specific surface-tension is always constant, and the
pressure varies inversely as the radius of curvature; therefore
the smaller the drop the more nearly is it able to conserve the
spherical form, and the larger the drop the more does it become
flattened under gravity. We can represent the phenomenon by
using india-rubber balls filled with water, of different sizes; the
little ones will remain very nearly spherical, but the larger will
fall down “of their own weight,” into the form of more and more
flattened cakes; and we see the same thing when we let drops of
heavy oil (such as the orthotoluidene spoken of on p. <a href="#p219" title="go to pg. 219">219</a>), fall
through a tall column of water, the little ones remaining round,
and the big ones getting more and more flattened as they sink.
In the case of the sea-urchin, the same series of forms may be
assumed to occur, irrespective of size, through variations in <i>T</i>,
the specific tension, or “strength,” of the enveloping shell.
Accordingly we may study, entirely from this point of view,
such a series as the following (Fig. <a href="#fig328" title="go to Fig. 328">328</a>). In a very few cases,
such as the fossil Palaeechinus, we have an
ap­prox­i­mate­ly spherical <span class="xxpn" id="p664">{664}</span>
shell, that is to say a shell so strong that the influence of gravity
becomes negligible as a cause of deformation. The ordinary
species of Echinus begin to display a pronounced depression, and
this reaches its maximum in such soft-shelled flexible forms as
Phormosoma. On the general question I took the opportunity
of consulting Mr C. R. Darling, who is an acknowledged expert
in drops, and he at once agreed with me that such forms as are
represented in Fig. <a href="#fig328" title="go to Fig. 328">328</a> are no other than diagrammatic illustrations</p>

<p class="pcontinue">of various kinds of drops, “most of which can easily be reproduced
in outline by the aid of liquids of ap­prox­i­mate­ly equal density to
water, although some of them are fugitive.” He found a difficulty
in the case of the outline which represents Asthenosoma, but the
reason for the anomaly is obvious; the flexible shell has flattened
down until it has come in contact with the hard skeleton of the
jaws, or “Aristotle’s lantern,” within, and the curvature of the
outline is accordingly disturbed. The elevated, conical shells
such as those of Urechinus and Coelopleurus evidently call for
some further explanation; for there is here some
cause at work <span class="xxpn" id="p665">{665}</span>
to elevate, rather than to depress the shell. Mr Darling tells me
that these forms “are nearly identical in shape with globules I
have frequently obtained, in which, on standing, bubbles of gas
rose to the summit and pressed the skin upwards, without being
able to escape.” The same condition may be at work in the
sea-urchin; but a similar tendency would also be manifested by
the presence in the upper part of the shell of any accumulation
of substance lighter than water, such as is actually present in the
masses of fatty, oily eggs.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3><i>On the Form and Branching of Blood-vessels</i></h3></div>

<p>Passing to what may seem a very different subject, we may
in­ves­ti­gate a number of interesting points in connection with the
form and structure of the blood-vessels, on the same principle
and by help of the same equations as those we have used, for
instance, in studying the egg-shell.</p>

<div class="dmaths">
<p>We know that the fluid pressure (<i>P</i>) within the vessel
is balanced by (1) the tension (<i>T</i>) of the wall, divided
by the radius of curvature, and (2) the external pressure
(<i>p&#xfeff;<sub>n</sub></i>), normal to the wall: according to our
formula</p>

<div><i>P</i>
=&#x202f;<i>p&#xfeff;<sub>n</sub></i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;<i>T</i>(1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>r</i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>r&#xfeff;′</i>).
</div>

<p class="pcontinue">If we neglect the external pressure, that is to say any support
which may be given to the vessel by the surrounding tissues, and
if we deal only with a cylindrical vein or artery, this formula
becomes simplified to the form <i>P</i>
=&#x202f;<i>T&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;R</i>. That is to say, under
constant pressure, the tension varies as the radius. But the
tension, per unit area of the vessel, depends upon the thickness
of the wall, that is to say on the amount of membranous and
especially of muscular tissue of which it is composed.</p>
</div><!--dmaths-->

<p>Therefore, so long as the pressure is constant, the thickness
of the wall should vary as the radius, or as the diameter, of the
blood-vessel. But it is not the case that the pressure is constant,
for it gradually falls off, by loss through friction, as we pass from
the large arteries to the small; and accordingly we find that while,
for a time, the cross-sections of the larger and smaller vessels are
symmetrical figures, with the wall-thickness proportional to the
size of the tube, this proportion is gradually lost,
and the walls <span class="xxpn" id="p666">{666}</span>
of the small arteries, and still more of the capillaries, become
exceedingly thin, and more so than in strict proportion to the
narrowing of the tube.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>In the case of the heart we have, within each of its cavities, a
pressure which, at any given moment, is constant over the whole
wall-area, but the thickness of the wall varies very considerably.
For instance, in the left ventricle, the apex is by much the thinnest
portion, as it is also that with the greatest curvature. We may
assume, therefore (or at least suspect), that the formula,
<i>t</i>(1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>r</i>&#x202f;+&#x202f;1&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>r&#xfeff;′</i>)
=&#x202f;<i>C</i>, holds good; that is to say, that the thickness (<i>t</i>)
of the wall varies inversely as the mean curvature. This may be
tested experimentally, by dilating a heart with alcohol under a
known pressure, and then measuring the thickness of the walls
in various parts after the whole organ has become hardened.
By this means it is found that, for each of the cavities, the law
holds good with great accuracy<a class="afnanch" href="#fn601" id="fnanch601">601</a>.
Moreover, if we begin by
dilating the right ventricle and then dilate the left in like manner,
until the whole heart is equally and symmetrically dilated, we
find (1) that we have had to use a pressure in the left ventricle
from six to seven times as great as in the right ventricle, and
(2) that the thickness of the walls is just in the same proportion<a class="afnanch" href="#fn602" id="fnanch602">602</a>.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>A great many other problems of a mechanical or hydrodynamical
kind arise in connection with the blood-vessels<a class="afnanch" href="#fn603" id="fnanch603">603</a>,
and
while these are chiefly interesting to the physiologist they have
also their interest for the morphologist in so far as they bear upon
structure and form. As an example of
such mechanical problems <span class="xxpn" id="p667">{667}</span>
we may take the conditions which determine or help to determine
the manner of branching of an artery, or the angle at which its
branches are given off; for, as John Hunter said<a class="afnanch" href="#fn604" id="fnanch604">604</a>,
“To keep up a
circulation sufficient for the part, and no more, Nature has varied
the angle of the origin of the arteries accordingly.” The general
principle is that the form and arrangement of the blood-vessels is
such that the circulation proceeds with a minimum of effort, and
with a minimum of wall-surface, the latter condition leading to a
minimum of friction and being therefore included in the first.
What, then, should be the angle of branching, such that there
shall be the least possible loss of energy in the course of the
circulation? In order to solve this problem in any particular
case we should obviously require to know (1) how the loss of
energy depends upon the distance travelled, and (2) how the loss
of energy varies with the diameter of the vessel. The loss of
energy is evidently greater in a narrow tube than in a wide one,
and greater, obviously, in a long journey than a short. If the</p>

<div class="dright dwth-f" id="fig329">
<img src="images/i667.png" width="288" height="312" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 329.</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">large artery, <i>AB</i>, give off a comparatively
narrow branch leading to <i>P</i> (such as <i>CP</i>,
or <i>DP</i>), the route <i>ACP</i> is evidently
shorter than <i>ADP</i>, but on the other
hand, by the latter path, the blood has
tarried longer in the wide vessel <i>AB</i>,
and has had a shorter course in the
narrow branch. The relative advantage
of the two paths will depend on the loss
of energy in the portion <i>CD</i>, as compared
with that in the alternative portion
<i>CD&#xfeff;′</i>, the latter being short and narrow, the former long and wide.
If we ask, then, which factor is the more important, length or
width, we may safely take it that the question is one of degree:
and that the factor of width will become much the more important
wherever the artery and its branch are markedly unequal in size.
In other words, it would seem that for small branches a large
angle of bifurcation, and for large branches a small one, is always
the better. Roux has laid down certain rules in regard to the
branching of arteries, which correspond
with the general <span class="xxpn" id="p668">{668}</span>
conclusions which we have just arrived at. The most important of
these are as follows: (1) If an artery bifurcate into two equal
branches, these branches come off at equal angles to the main
stem. (2) If one of the two branches be smaller than the other,
then the main branch, or continuation of the original artery,
makes with the latter a smaller angle than does the smaller or
“lateral” branch. And (3) all branches which are so small that
they scarcely seem to weaken or diminish the main stem come off
from it at a large angle, from about 70° to 90°.
<br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<div class="dleft dwth-e" id="fig330">
<img src="images/i668.png" width="336" height="534" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 330.</div></div>

<p>We may follow Hess in a further in­ves­ti­ga­tion of this
phenomenon. Let <i>AB</i> be an artery, from which a branch has
to be given off so as to reach <i>P</i>, and let <i>ACP</i>, <i>ADP</i>,
etc., be alternative courses which the branch may follow:
<i>CD</i>, <i>DE</i>, etc., in the diagram, being equal distances
(=&#x202f;<i>l</i>) along <i>AB</i>. Let us call the angles <i>PCD</i>,
<i>PCE</i>, <i>x</i>&#xfeff;<sub>1</sub>&#x202f;, <i>x</i>&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub>&#x202f;,
etc.: and the distances <i>CD&#xfeff;′</i>, <i>DE&#xfeff;′</i>, by which each
branch exceeds the next in length, we shall call
<i>l</i>&#xfeff;<sub>1</sub>&#x202f;, <i>l</i>&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub>&#x202f;, etc. Now
it is evident that, of the courses shewn, <i>ACP</i> is the
shortest which the blood can take, but it is also that by
which its transit through the narrow branch is the longest.
We may reduce its transit through the narrow branch more
and more, till we come to <i>CGP</i>, or rather to a point where
the branch comes off at right angles to the main stem;
but in so doing we very considerably increase the whole
distance travelled. We may take it that there will be
some intermediate point which will strike the balance of
advantage. <br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<p>Now it is easy to shew that if, in Fig. <a href="#fig330" title="go to Fig. 330">330</a>, the route <i>ADP</i> and
<i>AEP</i> (two contiguous routes) be equally favourable, then any
other route on either side of these, such as <i>ACP</i> or <i>AFP</i>, must
be less favourable than either. Let <i>ADP</i> and <i>AEP</i>, then, be
equally favourable; that is to say, let the loss of energy which
the blood suffers in its passage along these two
routes be equal. <span class="xxpn" id="p669">{669}</span>
Then, if we make the distance <i>DE</i> very small, the angles <i>x</i>&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub> and
<i>x</i>&#xfeff;<sub>3</sub> are nearly equal, and may be so treated. And again, if <i>DE</i>
be very small, then <i>DE&#xfeff;′E</i> becomes a right angle, and <i>l</i>&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub> (or
<i>DE&#xfeff;′</i>)
=&#x202f;<i>l</i>&#x202f;cos&#x202f;<i>x</i>&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub>&#x202f;.</p>

<p>But if <i>L</i> be the loss of energy per unit distance in
the wide tube <i>AB</i>, and <i>L&#xfeff;′</i> be the cor­re­spon­ding loss
of energy in the narrow tube <i>DP</i>, etc., then <i>lL</i>
<span class="nowrap">
=&#x202f;<i>l</i>&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub>&#x200a;<i>L&#xfeff;′</i>,</span> because, as we have assumed, the loss of
energy on the route <i>DP</i> is equal to that on the whole
route <i>DEP</i>. Therefore <i>lL</i>
=&#x202f;<i>lL&#xfeff;′</i>&#x202f;cos&#x202f;<i>x</i>&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub>&#x202f;, and
cos&#x202f;<i>x</i>&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub>
=&#x202f;<i>L&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;L&#xfeff;′</i>. That is to say, the most favourable
angle of branching will be such that the cosine of the
angle is equal to the ratio of the loss of energy which the
blood undergoes, per unit of length, in the main vessel, as
compared with that which it undergoes in the branch.</p>

<p>While these statements are so far true, and while they
undoubtedly cover a great number of observed facts, yet it is
plain that, as in all such cases, we must regard them not as a
complete explanation, but as <i>factors</i> in a complicated phenomenon:
not forgetting that (as the most learned of all students of the
heart and arteries, Dr Thomas Young, said in his Croonian
lecture<a class="afnanch" href="#fn605" id="fnanch605">605</a>)
all such questions as these, and all matters connected
with the muscular and elastic powers of the blood-vessels,
“belong to the most refined departments of hydraulics.” Some
other explanation must be sought in order to account for a
phenomenon which particularly impressed John Hunter’s mind,
namely the gradually altering angle at which the successive intercostal
arteries are given off from the thoracic aorta: the special
interest of this case arising from the regularity and symmetry of
the series, for “there is not another set of arteries in the body
whose origins are so much the same, whose offices are so much
the same, whose distances from their origin to the place of use,
and whose uses [? sizes]<a class="afnanch" href="#fn606" id="fnanch606">606</a>
are so much
the same.”</p>

<p>There is a certain large class of morphological problems of
which we have not yet spoken, and of which we shall be able to
say but little. Nevertheless they are so important, so full of
deep theoretical significance, and are so bound up with the general
question of form and of its determination as a result of growth,
that an essay on growth and form is bound to take account of
them, however imperfectly and briefly. The phenomena which
I have in mind are just those many cases where <i>adaptation</i>, in the
strictest sense, is obviously present, in the clearly demonstrable
form of mechanical fitness for the exercise of some particular
function or action which has become inseparable from the life
and well-being of the organism.</p>

<p>When we discuss certain so-called “adaptations” to outward
circumstance, in the way of form, colour and so forth, we are often
apt to use illustrations convincing enough to certain minds but
unsatisfying to others—in other words, incapable of demonstration.
With regard to colouration, for instance, it is by colours
“cryptic,” “warning,” “signalling,” “mimetic,” and so
on<a class="afnanch" href="#fn607" id="fnanch607">607</a>,
that we prosaically expound, and slavishly profess to justify, the
vast Aristotelian synthesis that Nature makes all things with a
purpose and “does nothing in vain.” Only for a moment let us
glance at some few instances by which the modern teleologist
accounts for this or that manifestation of colour, and is led on
and on to beliefs and doctrines to which it becomes more and more
difficult to subscribe. <span class="xxpn" id="p671">{671}</span></p>

<p>Some dangerous and malignant animals are said (in sober

<p>To buttress the theory of natural selection the same
instances of “adaptation” (and many more) are used, which in
an earlier but not distant age testified to the wisdom of the
Creator and revealed to simple piety the high purpose of God.
In the words of a certain learned theologian<a class="afnanch"
href="#fn613" id="fnanch613">613</a>, “The free use of
final causes to explain what seems obscure was temptingly
easy&#x200a;....&#x200a;Hence the finalist was often the man
who made a liberal use of the <i>ignava ratio</i>, or lazy argument:
when you failed to explain a thing by the ordinary process of
causality, you could “explain” it by reference to some purpose
of nature or of its Creator. This method lent itself with
dangerous facility to the well-meant endeavours of the older
theologians to expound and emphasise the beneficence of the
divine purpose.” <i>Mutatis mutandis</i>, the passage carries its
plain message to the naturalist.</p>

<p>The fate of such arguments or illustrations is always the
same. They attract and captivate for awhile; they go to the
building of a creed, which contemporary orthodoxy defends under
its severest penalties: but the time comes when they lose their
fascination, they somehow cease to satisfy and to convince,
their foundations are discovered to be insecure, and in the end
no man troubles to controvert them.</p>

<p>But of a very different order from all such “adaptations” as
these, are those very perfect adaptations of form which, for
instance, fit a fish for swimming or a bird for
flight. Here we are <span class="xxpn" id="p673">{673}</span>
far above the region of mere hypothesis, for we have to deal with
questions of mechanical efficiency where statical and dynamical
con­si­de­ra­tions can be applied and established in detail. The
naval architect learns a great part of his lesson from the in­ves­ti­ga­tion
of the stream-lines of a fish; and the math­e­mat­i­cal study
of the stream-lines of a bird, and of the principles underlying the
areas and curvatures of its wings and tail, has helped to lay the
very foundations of the modern science of aeronautics. When,
after attempting to comprehend the exquisite adaptation of the
swallow or the albatross to the navigation of the air, we try to
pass beyond the empirical study and contemplation of such
perfection of mechanical fitness, and to ask how such fitness came
to be, then indeed we may be excused if we stand wrapt in wonderment,
and if our minds be occupied and even satisfied with the
conception of a final cause. And yet all the while, with no loss
of wonderment nor lack of reverence, do we find ourselves constrained
to believe that somehow or other, in dynamical principles
and natural law, there lie hidden the steps and stages of physical
causation by which the material structure was so shapen to its
ends<a class="afnanch" href="#fn614" id="fnanch614">614</a>.</p>

<p>But the problems associated with these phenomena are
difficult at every stage, even long before we approach to the
unsolved secrets of causation; and for my part I readily confess
that I lack the requisite knowledge for even an elementary
discussion of the form of a fish or of a bird. But in the form of
a bone we have a problem of the same kind and order, so far
simplified and particularised that we may to some extent deal
with it, and may possibly even find, in our partial comprehension
of it, a partial clue to the principles of causation underlying this
whole class of problems.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Before we speak of the form of a bone, let us say a word about,
the mechanical properties of the material of which
it is built<a class="afnanch" href="#fn615" id="fnanch615">615</a>,
in <span class="xxpn" id="p674">{674}</span>
relation to the strength it has to manifest or the forces it has to
resist: understanding always that we mean thereby the properties
of fresh or living bone, with all its organic as well as inorganic
constituents, for dead, dry bone is a very different thing. In all
the structures raised by the engineer, in beams, pillars and girders
of every kind, provision has to be made, somehow or other, for
strength of two kinds, strength to resist compression or crushing,
and strength to resist tension or pulling asunder. The evenly
loaded column is designed with a view to supporting a downward
pressure, the wire-rope, like the tendon of a muscle, is adapted
only to resist a tensile stress; but in many or most cases the two
functions are very closely inter-related and combined. The case
of a loaded beam is a familiar one; though, by the way, we are
now told that it is by no means so simple as it looks, and indeed
that “the stresses and strains in this log of timber are so complex
that the problem has not yet been solved in a manner that reasonably
accords with the known strength of the beam as found by
actual experiment<a class="afnanch" href="#fn616" id="fnanch616">616</a>.”
However, be that as it may, we know,</p>

<div class="dleft dwth-e" id="fig331">
<img src="images/i674.png" width="336" height="216" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 331.</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">roughly, that when the beam is
loaded in the middle and supported at both ends, it
tends to be bent into an arc, in which condition its
lower fibres are being stretched, or are undergoing a
tensile stress, while its upper fibres are undergoing
compression. It follows that in some intermediate layer
there is a “neutral zone,” where the fibres of the wood
are subject to no stress of either kind. In like manner,
a vertical pillar if unevenly loaded (as, for instance,
the shaft of our thigh-bone normally is) will tend to
bend, and so to endure compression on its concave, and
tensile stress upon its convex side. In many cases it
is the business of the engineer to separate out, as far
as possible, the pressure-lines from the tension-lines,
in order to use separate modes of construction, or even
different materials for each. In a <span class="xxpn"
id="p675">{675}</span> suspension-bridge, for instance,
a great part of the fabric is subject to tensile strain
only, and is built throughout of ropes or wires; but
the massive piers at either end of the bridge carry the
weight of the whole structure and of its load, and endure
all the “compression-strains” which are inherent in the
system. Very much the same is the case in that wonderful
arrangement of struts and ties which constitute, or
complete, the skeleton of an animal. The “skeleton,” as we
see it in a Museum, is a poor and even a misleading picture
of mechanical efficiency<a class="afnanch" href="#fn617"
id="fnanch617">617</a>. From the engineer’s point of view,
it is a diagram showing all the compression-lines, but by
no means all of the tension-lines of the construction; it
shews all the struts, but few of the ties, and perhaps we
might even say <i>none</i> of the principal ones; it falls all
to pieces unless we clamp it together, as best we can, in
a more or less clumsy and immobilised way. But in life,
that fabric of struts is surrounded and interwoven with a
complicated system of ties: ligament and membrane, muscle
and tendon, run between bone and bone; and the beauty and
strength of the mechanical construction lie not in one part
or in another, but in the complete fabric which all the
parts, soft and hard, rigid and flexible, tension-bearing
and pressure-bearing, make up together<a class="afnanch"
href="#fn618" id="fnanch618">618</a>. <br class="brclrfix"
/></p>

<p>However much we may find a tendency, whether in nature or
art, to separate these two constituent factors of tension and
compression, we cannot do so completely; and accordingly the
engineer seeks for a material which shall, as nearly as possible,
offer equal resistance to both kinds of strain. In the following
table—I borrow it from Sir Donald MacAlister—we see ap­prox­i­mate­ly
the relative breaking (or tearing) limit and crushing limit
in a few substances. <span class="xxpn" id="p676">{676}</span></p>

<p>At first sight, bone seems weak indeed; but it has the great
and unusual advantage that it is very nearly as good for a tie
as for a strut, nearly as strong to withstand rupture, or tearing
asunder, as to resist crushing. We see that wrought-iron is only
half as strong to withstand the former as the latter; while in
cast-iron there is a still greater discrepancy the other way, for it
makes a good strut but a very bad tie indeed. Cast-steel is not
only actually stronger than any of these, but it also possesses,
like bone, the two kinds of strength in no very great relative
disproportion.</p>

<p>When the engineer constructs an iron or steel girder, to
take the place of the primitive wooden beam, we know that he
takes advantage of the elementary principle we have spoken of,
and saves weight and economises material by leaving out as
far as possible all the middle portion, all the parts in the
neighbourhood of the “neutral zone”; and in so doing he reduces
his girder to an upper and lower “flange,” connected together
by a “web,” the whole resembling, in cross-section, an <span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-a"
src="images/i676-glyph-i.png" width="25" height="60" alt="I" /></span>
or an <span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-a"
src="images/i676-glyph-ibeam.png" width="45" height="60" alt="⌶" />.</span></p>

<p>But it is obvious that, if the strains in the two
flanges are to be equal as well as opposite, and if the
material be such as cast-iron or wrought-iron, one or
other flange must be made much thicker than the other
in order that it may be equally strong; and if at times
the two flanges have, as it were, to change places, or
play each other’s parts, then there must be introduced a
margin of safety by making both flanges thick enough to
meet that kind of stress in regard to which the material
happens to be weakest. There is great economy, then, in any
material which is, as nearly as possible, equally strong
in both ways; and so we see that, from the engineer’s
or contractor’s point of view, bone is a very good and
suitable material for purposes of construction. <span
class="xxpn" id="p677">{677}</span></p>

<p>The <span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-a"
src="images/i676-glyph-i.png" width="25" height="60" alt="I" /></span>
or the <em class="embold">H</em>-girder or rail is designed to resist bending in one
particular direction, but if, as in a tall pillar, it be necessary to
resist bending in all directions alike, it is obvious that the tubular
or cylindrical construction best meets the case; for it is plain
that this hollow tubular pillar is but the
<span class="nowrap"><img class="iglyph-a"
src="images/i676-glyph-i.png" width="25" height="60"
alt="I" />-girder</span> turned round
every way, in a “solid of revolution,” so that on any two opposite
sides compression and tension are equally met and resisted, and
there is now no need for any substance at all in the way of web
or “filling” within the hollow core of the tube. And it is not only
in the supporting pillar that such a construction is useful; it is
appropriate in every case where <i>stiffness</i> is required, where bending
has to be resisted. The long bone of a bird’s wing has little or
no weight to carry, but it has to withstand powerful bending
moments; and in the arm-bone of a long-winged bird, such as
an albatross, we see the tubular construction manifested in its
perfection, the bony substance being reduced to a thin, perfectly
cylindrical, and almost empty shell. The quill of the bird’s
feather, the hollow shaft of a reed, the thin tube of the wheat-straw
bearing its heavy burden in the ear, are all illustrations
which Galileo used in his account of this mechanical principle<a class="afnanch" href="#fn619" id="fnanch619">619</a>.</p>

<p>Two points, both of considerable importance, present themselves
here, and we may deal with them before we go further. In the
first place, it is not difficult to see that, in our bending beam, the
strain is greatest at its middle; if we press our walking-stick hard
against the ground, it will tend to snap midway. Hence, if our
cylindrical column be exposed to strong bending stresses, it will
be prudent and economical to make its walls thickest in the middle
and thinning off gradually towards the ends; and if we look at
a longitudinal section of a thigh-bone, we shall see that this is
just what nature has done. The thickness of the walls is nothing
less than a diagram, or “graph,” of the “bending-moments”
from one point to another along the length of the bone.</p>

<div class="dleft dwth-f" id="fig332">
<img src="images/i678.png" width="288" height="183" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 332.</div></div>

<p>The second point requires a little more explanation. If
we <span class="xxpn" id="p678">{678}</span> imagine our
loaded beam to be supported at one end only (for instance,
by being built into a wall), so as to form what is called
a “bracket” or “cantilever,” then we can see, without
much difficulty, that the lines of stress in the beam
run somewhat as in the accompanying diagram. Immediately
under the load, the “compression-lines” tend to run
vertically downward; but where the bracket is fastened to
the wall, there is pressure directed horizontally against
the wall in the lower part of the surface of attachment;
and the vertical beginning and the horizontal end of
these pressure-lines must be continued into one another
in the form of some even math­e­mat­i­cal curve—which, as it
happens, is part of a parabola. The tension-lines are
identical in form with the compression-lines, of which they
constitute the “mirror-image”; and where the two systems
intercross, they do so at right angles, or “orthogonally”
to one another. Such systems of stress-lines as these we
shall deal with again; but let us take note here of the
important, though well-nigh obvious fact, that while in
the beam they both unite to carry the load, yet it is
always possible to weaken one set of lines at the expense
of the other, and in some cases to do altogether away with
one set or the other. For example, when we replace our
end-supported beam by a curved bracket, bent upwards or
downwards as the case may be, we have evidently cut away
in the one case the greater part of the tension-lines, and
in the other the greater part of the compression-lines.
And if instead of bridging a stream with our beam of
wood we bridge it with a rope, it is evident that this
new construction contains all the tension-lines, but
none of the compression-lines of the old. The biological
interest connected with this principle lies chiefly in
the mechanical construction of the rush or the straw, or
any other typically cylindrical stem. The material of
which the stalk is constructed is very weak to withstand
compression, but parts of it have a very great tensile
strength. Schwendener, who was both botanist and engineer,
has elaborately investigated the factor of strength in
the cylindrical stem, which Galileo was the first to call
attention to. <span class="xxpn" id="p679">{679}</span>
Schwendener<a class="afnanch" href="#fn620"
id="fnanch620">620</a> shewed that the strength was
concentrated in the little bundles of “bast-tissue” but
that these bast-fibres had a tensile strength per square
mm. of section, up to the limit of elasticity, not less
than that of steel-wire of such quality as was in use in
his day. <br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<p>For instance, we see in the following table the load which
various fibres, and various wires, were found capable of sustaining,
not up to the breaking-point, but up to the “elastic limit,” or
point beyond which complete recovery to the original length took
place no longer after release of the load.</p>

<p>In other respects, it is true, the plant-fibres were inferior to
the wires; for the former broke asunder very soon after the
limit of elasticity was passed, while the iron-wire could stand,
before snapping, three times the load which was measured by its
limit of elasticity: in the language of a modern engineer, the
bast-fibres had a low “yield-point,” little above the elastic limit.
But nevertheless, within certain limits, plant-fibre and wire were
just as good and strong one as the other. And then Schwendener
proceeds to shew, in many beautiful diagrams, the various ways
in which these strands of strong tensile tissue are arranged in
various cases: sometimes, in the simpler cases, forming numerous
small bundles arranged in a peripheral ring, not quite at the
periphery, for a certain amount of space has to be left for living
and active tissue; sometimes in a sparser ring
of larger and <span class="xxpn" id="p680">{680}</span>
stronger bundles; sometimes with these bundles further strengthened
by radial balks or ridges; sometimes with all the fibres set</p>

<div class="dleft dwth-d" id="fig333">

<p class="pcontinue">close together in a continuous hollow
cylinder. In the case figured in Fig. <a href="#fig333" title="go to Fig. 333">333</a> Schwendener
calculated that the resistance to bending was at least
twenty-five times as great as it would have been had the
six main bundles been brought close together in a solid
core. In many cases the centre of the stem is altogether
empty; in all other cases it is filled with soft tissue,
suitable for the ascent of sap or other functions, but
never such as to confer mechanical rigidity. In a tall
conical stem, such as that of a palm-tree, we can see
not only these principles in the construction of the
cylindrical trunk, but we can observe, towards the apex,
the bundles of fibre curving over and intercrossing
orthogonally with one another, exactly after the fashion of
our stress-lines in Fig. <a href="#fig332" title="go to Fig. 332">332</a>; but of course, in this case,
we are still dealing with tensile members, the opposite
bundles taking on in turn, as the tree sways, the alternate
function of resisting tensile strain<a class="afnanch"
href="#fn621" id="fnanch621">621</a>. <br class="brclrfix"

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Let us now come, at last, to the mechanical structure of bone,
of which we find a well-known and classical illustration in the
various bones of the human leg. In the case of the tibia, the bone
is somewhat widened out above, and its hollow shaft is capped
by an almost flattened roof, on which the weight of the body
directly rest. It is obvious that, under these circumstances, the
engineer would find it necessary to devise means for supporting
this flat roof, and for distributing the vertical pressures which
impinge upon it to the cylindrical walls of
the shaft. <span class="xxpn" id="p681">{681}</span></p>

<p>In the case of the bird’s wing-bone, the hollow of the bone is
practically empty, as we have already said, being filled only with
air save for a thin layer of living tissue immediately within the
cylinder of bone; but in our own bones, and all weight-carrying
bones in general, the hollow space is filled with marrow, blood-vessels
and other tissues; and among these living tissues lies a
fine lattice-work of little interlaced “trabeculae” of bone, forming</p>

<p class="pcontinue">
the so-called “cancellous tissue.” The older anatomists were
content to describe this cancellous tissue as a sort of “spongy
network,” or irregular honeycomb, until, some fifty years ago, a
remarkable discovery was made regarding it. It was found by
Hermann Meyer (and afterwards shewn in greater detail by
Julius Wolff and others) that the trabeculae, as seen in a longitudinal
section of a long bone, were arranged in a very definite
and orderly way; in the femur, they spread
in beautiful curving <span class="xxpn" id="p682">{682}</span>
lines from the head to the tubular shaft of the bone, and these
bundles of lines were crossed by others, with so nice a regularity
of arrangement that each intercrossing was as nearly as
possible an orthogonal one: that is to say, the one set of fibres
crossed the other everywhere at right angles. A great engineer,
Professor Culmann of Zürich (to whom, by the way, we owe the
whole modern method of “graphic statics”), happened to see
some of Meyer’s drawings and preparations, and he recognised
in a moment that in the arrangement of the trabeculae we had</p>

<p class="pcontinue">nothing more nor less than a diagram of the lines of stress, or
directions of compression and tension, in the loaded structure:
in short, that nature was strengthening the bone in precisely the
manner and direction in which strength was needed. In the
accompanying diagram of a crane-head, by Culmann, we recognise
a slight modification (caused entirely by the curved shape of the
structure) of the still simpler lines of tension and compression
which we have already seen in our end-supported beam as
represented in Fig. <a href="#fig332" title="go to Fig. 332">332</a>. In the shaft of the
crane, the concave <span class="xxpn" id="p683">{683}</span>

the outer side is the “tension-member”; and the
pressure-lines, starting from the loaded surface, gather themselves
together, always in the direction of the resultant pressure, till
they form a close bundle running down the compressed side
of the shaft: while the tension-lines, running upwards along the
opposite side of the shaft, spread out through the head, orthogonally
to, and linking together, the system of compression-lines.
The head of the femur (Fig. <a href="#fig335" title="go to Fig. 335">335</a>) is a little more complicated in
form and a little less symmetrical than Culmann’s diagrammatic
crane, from which it chiefly differs in the fact that the load is
divided into two parts, that namely which is borne by the head
of the bone, and that smaller portion which rests upon the great
trochanter; but this merely amounts to saying that a <i>notch</i> has
been cut out of the curved upper surface of the structure, and we
have no difficulty in seeing that the anatomical arrangement of
the trabeculae follows precisely the mechanical distribution of
compressive and tensile stress or, in other words, accords perfectly
with the theoretical stress-diagram of the crane. The lines of
stress are bundled close together along the sides of the shaft, and
lost or concealed there in the substance of the solid wall of bone;
but in and near the head of the bone, a peripheral shell of bone
does not suffice to contain them, and they spread out through the
central mass in the actual concrete form of
bony trabeculae<a class="afnanch" href="#fn622" id="fnanch622">622</a>.
<span class="xxpn" id="p684">{684}</span></p>

<p><i>Mutatis mutandis</i>, the same phenomenon may be traced in any
other bone which carries weight and is liable to flexure; and in
the <i>os calcis</i> and the tibia, and more or less in all the bones of the
lower limb, the arrangement is found to be very simple and
clear.</p>

 <div class="pcaption">Fig. 336. Diagram of stress-lines in the
human foot. (From Sir D. MacAlister, after H. Meyer.)</div></div>

<p>Thus, in the <i>os calcis</i>, the weight resting on the head of the
bone has to be transmitted partly through the backward-projecting
heel to the ground, and partly forwards through its articulation
with the cuboid bone, to the arch of the foot. We thus have,
very much as in a triangular roof-tree, two compression-members,
sloping apart from one another; and these have to be bound
together by a “tie” or tension-member, cor­re­spon­ding to the
third, horizontal member of the truss.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>So far, dealing wholly with the stresses and strains due to
tension and compression, we have altogether omitted to speak
of a third very important factor in the engineer’s calculations,
namely what is known as “shearing stress.” A shearing force is
one which produces “angular distortion” in a figure, or (what
comes to the same thing) which tends to
cause its particles to <span class="xxpn" id="p685">{685}</span>
slide over one another. A shearing stress is a somewhat complicated
thing, and we must try to illustrate it (however
imperfectly) in the simplest possible way. If we build up a pillar,
for instance, of a pile of flat horizontal slates, or of a pack of
cards, a vertical load placed upon it will produce compression, but
will have no tendency to cause one card to slide, or shear, upon
another; and in like manner, if we make up a cable of parallel
wires and, letting it hang vertically, load it evenly with a weight,
again the tensile stress produced has no tendency to cause one
wire to slip or shear upon another. But the case would have</p>

<p class="pcontinue">
been very different if we had built up our pillar of cards or slates
lying obliquely to the lines of pressure, for then at once there
would have been a tendency for the elements of the pile to slip
and slide asunder, and to produce what the geologists call “a
fault” in the structure.</p>

<div class="psmprnt3">
<p>Somewhat more generally, if <i>AB</i> be a bar, or pillar, of cross-section <i>a</i>
under a direct load <i>P</i>, giving a stress per unit area
=&#x202f;<i>p</i>, then the whole
pressure <i>P</i>

cross-section; the pressure on <i>CD</i> will evidently be

point <i>O</i> in <i>CD</i>, the pressure <i>P</i> may be resolved into the force <i>Q</i> acting along

<div class="dleft dwth-f" id="fig338">
<img src="images/i686.png" width="288" height="378" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 338.</div></div>

<p>This is as much as to say, that a
shearing stress vanishes altogether along
the lines of maximum compression or
tension; it has a definite value in all
other positions, and a maximum value
when it is inclined at 45° to either, or
half-way between the two. This may be
further illustrated in various simple ways.
When we submit a cubical block of iron
to compression in the testing machine, it
does not tend to give way by crumbling
all to pieces; but as a rule it disrupts by shearing, and along
some plane ap­prox­i­mate­ly at 45° to the axis of compression.
Again, in the beam which we have already considered under a
bending moment, we know that if we substitute for it a pack of
cards, they will be strongly sheared on one another; and the
shearing stress is greatest in the “neutral zone,” where neither
tension nor compression is manifested: that is to say in the line
which cuts at equal angles of 45° the orthogonally intersecting
lines of pressure and tension. <br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<p>In short we see that, while shearing <i>stresses</i> can by no means
be got rid of, the danger of rupture or breaking-down under
shearing stress is completely got rid of when we arrange the
materials of our construction wholly along the pressure-lines and
tension-lines of the system; for <i>along these lines</i> there is no shear.</p>

<p>To apply these principles to the growth and development of
our bone, we have only to imagine a little trabecula (or group of
trabeculae) being secreted and laid down fortuitously in any
direction within the substance of the bone. If it lie in the
direction of one of the pressure-lines, for instance, it will be in
a position of comparative equi­lib­rium, or minimal disturbance;
but if it be inclined obliquely to the pressure-lines, the shearing
force will at once tend to act upon it and move it away. This
is neither more nor less than what happens when
we comb our <span class="xxpn" id="p687">{687}</span>
hair, or card a lock of wool: filaments lying in the direction of
the comb’s path remain where they were; but the others, under
the influence of an oblique component of pressure, are sheared
out of their places till they too come into coincidence with the
lines of force. So straws show how the wind blows—or rather
how it has been blowing. For every straw that lies askew to the
wind’s path tends to be sheared into it; but as soon as it has
come to lie the way of the wind it tends to be disturbed no
more, save (of course) by a violence such as to hurl it bodily
away.</p>

<p>In the biological aspect of the case, we must always remember
that our bone is not only a living, but a highly plastic
structure; the little trabeculae are constantly being formed and
deformed, demolished and formed anew. Here, for once, it is
safe to say that “heredity” need not and cannot be invoked to
account for the configuration and arrangement of the trabeculae:
for we can see them, at any time of life, in the making, under the
direct action and control of the forces to which the system is
exposed. If a bone be broken and so repaired that its parts lie
somewhat out of their former place, so that the pressure-and
tension-lines have now a new distribution, before many weeks are
over the trabecular system will be found to have been entirely
remodelled, so as to fall into line with the new system of forces.
And as Wolff pointed out, this process of reconstruction extends
a long way off from the seat of injury, and so cannot be looked
upon as a mere accident of the physiological process of healing
and repair; for instance, it may happen that, after a fracture of
the <i>shaft</i> of a long bone, the trabecular meshwork is wholly altered
and reconstructed within the distant <i>extremities</i> of the bone.
Moreover, in cases of transplantation of bone, for example when
a diseased metacarpal is repaired by means of a portion taken
from the lower end of the ulna, with astonishing quickness the
plastic capabilities of the bony tissue are so manifested that
neither in outward form nor inward structure can the old portion
be distinguished from the new.</p>

<p>Herein then lies, so far as we can discern it, a great part at
least of the physical causation of what at first sight strikes us as
a purely functional adaptation: as a phenomenon,
in other words, <span class="xxpn" id="p688">{688}</span>
whose physical cause is as obscure as its final cause or end is,
apparently, manifest.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Partly associated with the same phenomenon, and partly to
be looked upon (meanwhile at least) as a fact apart, is the very
important physiological truth that a condition of <i>strain</i>, the
result of a <i>stress</i>, is a direct stimulus to growth itself. This indeed
is no less than one of the cardinal facts of theoretical biology.
The soles of our boots wear thin, but the soles of our feet grow
thick, the more we walk upon them: for it would seem that the
living cells are “stimulated” by pressure, or by what we call
“exercise,” to increase and multiply. The surgeon knows, when
he bandages a broken limb, that his bandage is doing something
more than merely keeping the parts together: and that the even,
constant pressure which he skilfully applies is a direct encouragement
of growth and an active agent in the process of repair. In the
classical experiments of Sédillot<a class="afnanch" href="#fn623" id="fnanch623">623</a>,
the greater part of the shaft of the
tibia was excised in some young puppies, leaving the whole weight
of the body to rest upon the fibula. The latter bone is normally
about one-fifth or sixth of the diameter of the tibia; but under
the new conditions, and under the “stimulus” of the increased
load, it grew till it was as thick or even thicker than the normal
bulk of the larger bone. Among plant tissues this phenomenon
is very apparent, and in a somewhat remarkable way; for a strain
caused by a constant or increasing weight (such as that in the
stalk of a pear while the pear is growing and ripening) produces
a very marked increase of <i>strength</i> without any necessary increase
of bulk, but rather by some histological, or molecular, alteration
of the tissues. Hegler, and also Pfeffer, have investigated this
subject, by loading the young shoot of a plant nearly to its
breaking point, and then redetermining the breaking-strength
after a few days. Some young shoots of the sunflower were found
to break with a strain of 160 gms.; but when loaded with 150 gms.,
and retested after two days, they were able to support 250 gms.;
and being again loaded with something short of this, by next day
they sustained 300 gms., and a few days
later even 400 gms. <span class="xxpn" id="p689">{689}</span></p>

<p>Such experiments have been amply confirmed, but so far as
I am aware, we do not know much more about the matter: we
do not know, for instance, how far the change is accompanied by
increase in number of the bast-fibres, through transformation of
other tissues; or how far it is due to increase in size of these
fibres; or whether it be not simply due to strengthening of the
original fibres by some molecular change. But I should be much
inclined to suspect that the latter had a good deal to do with the
phenomenon. We know nowadays that a railway axle, or any
other piece of steel, is weakened by a constant succession of
frequently interrupted strains; it is said to be “fatigued,” and
its strength is restored by a period of rest. The converse effect
of continued strain in a uniform direction may be illustrated by
a homely example. The confectioner takes a mass of boiled
sugar or treacle (in a particular molecular condition determined
by the temperature to which it has been exposed), and draws the
soft sticky mass out into a rope; and then, folding it up lengthways,
he repeats the process again and again. At first the rope is pulled
out of the ductile mass without difficulty; but as the work goes
on it gets harder to do, until all the man’s force is used to stretch
the rope. Here we have the phenomenon of increasing strength,
following mechanically on a rearrangement of molecules, as the
original isotropic condition is transmuted more and more into
molecular asymmetry or anisotropy; and the rope apparently
“adapts itself” to the increased strain which it is called on to bear,
all after a fashion which at least suggests a parallel to the increasing
strength of the stretched and weighted fibre in the plant. For
increase of strength by rearrangement of the particles we have
already a rough illustration in our lock of wool or hank of tow.
The piece of tow will carry but little weight while its fibres are
tangled and awry: but as soon as we have carded it out, and
brought all its long fibres parallel and side by side, we may at once
make of it a strong and useful cord.</p>

<p>In some such ways as these, then, it would seem that we may
co-ordinate, or hope to co-ordinate, the phenomenon of growth
with certain of the beautiful structural phenomena which present
themselves to our eyes as “provisions,” or mechanical adaptations,
for the display of strength where strength
is most required. <span class="xxpn" id="p690">{690}</span>
That is to say, the origin, or causation, of the phenomenon would
seem to lie, partly in the tendency of growth to be accelerated
under strain: and partly in the automatic effect of shearing
strain, by which it tends to displace parts which grow obliquely
to the direct lines of tension and of pressure, while leaving those
in place which happen to lie parallel or perpendicular to those
lines: an automatic effect which we can probably trace as working
on all scales of magnitude, and as accounting therefore for the
rearrangement of minute particles in the metal or the fibre, as
well as for the bringing into line of the fibres themselves within
the plant, or of the little trabeculae within the bone.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>But we may now attempt to pass from the study of the
individual bone to the much wider and not less beautiful problems
of mechanical construction which are presented to us by the
skeleton as a whole. Certain problems of this class are by no
means neglected by writers on anatomy, and many have been
handed down from Borelli, and even from older writers. For
instance, it is an old tradition of anatomical teaching to point
out in the human body examples of the three orders of levers<a class="afnanch" href="#fn624" id="fnanch624">624</a>;
again, the principle that the limb-bones tend to be shortened in
order to support the weight of a very heavy animal is well understood
by comparative anatomists, in accordance with Euler’s law,
that the weight which a column liable to flexure is capable of
supporting varies inversely as the square of its length; and again,
the statical equi­lib­rium of the body, in relation for instance to
the erect posture of man, has long been a favourite theme of the
philosophical anatomist. But the general method, based upon
that of graphic statics, to which we have been introduced in our
study of a bone, has not, so far as I know, been applied to the
general fabric of the skeleton. Yet it is plain
that each bone plays <span class="xxpn" id="p691">{691}</span>
a part in relation to the whole body, analogous to that which a
little trabecula, or a little group of trabeculae, plays within the
bone itself: that is to say, in the normal distribution of forces
in the body, the bones tend to follow the lines of stress, and
especially the pressure-lines. To demonstrate this in a comprehensive
way would doubtless be difficult; for we should be dealing
with a framework of very great complexity, and should have to
take account of a great variety of conditions<a class="afnanch" href="#fn625" id="fnanch625">625</a>.
This framework
is complicated as we see it in the skeleton, where (as we have said)
it is only, or chiefly, the <i>struts</i> of the whole fabric which are
represented; but to understand the mechanical structure in
detail, we should have to follow out the still more complex
arrangement of the <i>ties</i>, as represented by the muscles and
ligaments, and we should also require much detailed information
as to the weights of the various parts and as to the other forces
concerned. Without these latter data we can only treat the
question in a preliminary and imperfect way. But, to take once
again a small and simplified part of a big problem, let us think
of a quadruped (for instance, a horse) in a standing posture, and
see whether the methods and terminology of the engineer may not
help us, as they did in regard to the minute structure of the single
bone.</p>

<p>Standing four-square upon its forelegs and hindlegs, with the
weight of the body suspended between, the quadruped at once
suggests to us the analogy of a bridge, carried by its two piers.
And if it occurs to us, as naturalists, that we never look at a
standing quadruped without contemplating a bridge, so, conversely,
a similar idea has occurred to the engineer; for Professor
Fidler, in this <i>Treatise on Bridge-Construction</i>, deals with the chief
descriptive part of his subject under the heading of “The Comparative
Anatomy of Bridges.” The designation is most just, for
in studying the various types of bridges we are studying a series
of well-planned <i>skeletons</i><a class="afnanch" href="#fn626" id="fnanch626">626</a>;
and (at the cost of
a little pedantry) <span class="xxpn" id="p692">{692}</span>
we might go even further, and study (after the fashion of the
anatomist) the “osteology” and “desmology” of the structure,
that is to say the bones which are represented by “struts,” and
the ligaments, etc., which are represented by “ties.” Furthermore
after the methods of the comparative anatomist, we may
classify the families, genera and species of bridges according to
their distinctive mechanical features, which correspond to certain
definite conditions and functions.</p>

<p>In more ways than one, the quadrupedal bridge is a remarkable
one; and perhaps its most remarkable peculiarity is that it is a
jointed and flexible bridge, remaining in equi­lib­rium under
considerable and sometimes great modifications of its curvature,
such as we see, for instance, when a cat humps or flattens her
back. The fact that <i>flexibility</i> is an essential feature in the
quadrupedal bridge, while it is the last thing which an engineer
desires and the first which he seeks to provide against, will impose
certain important limiting conditions upon the design of the
skeletal fabric; but to this matter we shall afterwards return.
Let us begin by considering the quadruped at rest, when he stands
upright and motionless upon his feet, and when his legs exercise
no function save only to carry the weight of the whole body. So
far as that function is concerned, we might now perhaps compare
the horse’s legs with the tall and slender piers of some railway
bridge; but it is obvious that these jointed legs are ill-adapted
to receive the <i>horizontal thrust</i> of any <i>arch</i> that may be placed
atop of them. Hence it follows that the curved backbone of the
horse, which appears to cross like an arch the span between his
shoulders and his flanks, cannot be regarded
as an <i>arch</i>, in the <span class="xxpn" id="p693">{693}</span>
engineer’s sense of the word. It resembles an arch in <i>form</i>, but
not in <i>function</i>, for it cannot act as an arch unless it be held back
at each end (as every arch is held back) by <i>abutments</i> capable of
resisting the horizontal thrust; and these necessary abutments
are not present in the structure. But in various ways the
engineer can modify his superstructure so as to supply the place
of these <i>external</i> reactions, which in the simple arch are obviously
indispensable. Thus, for example, we may begin by inserting a
straight steel tie, <i>AB</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig339" title="go to Fig. 339">339</a>), uniting the ends of the curved rib
<i>AaB</i>; and this tie will supply the place of the external reactions,
converting the structure into a “tied arch,” such as we may see
in the roofs of many railway-stations. Or we may go on to fill
in the space between arch and tie by a “web-system,” converting
it into what the engineer describes as a “parabolic bowstring
girder” (Fig. <a href="#fig339" title="go to Fig. 339">339</a><i>b</i>). In either case, the structure becomes an</p>

<div class="dctr02" id="fig339">
<img src="images/i693.png" width="704" height="259" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 339.</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">independent “detached girder,” supported at each end but not
otherwise fixed, and consisting essentially of an upper compression-member,
<i>AaB</i>, and a lower tension-member, <i>AB</i>. But again, in
the skeleton of the quadruped, <i>the necessary tie</i>, <i>AB</i>, <i>is not to be
found</i>; and it follows that these comparatively simple types of
bridge do not correspond to, nor do they help us to understand,
the type of bridge which nature has designed in the skeleton of
the quadruped. Nevertheless if we try to look, as an engineer
would look, at the actual design of the animal skeleton and the
actual distribution of its load, we find that, the one is most admirably
adapted to the other, according to the strict principles of
engineering construction. The structure is not an arch, nor a
tied arch, nor a bowstring girder: but it is
strictly and beautifully <span class="xxpn" id="p694">{694}</span>
comparable to the main girder of a double-armed cantilever
bridge.</p>

<p>Obviously, in our quadrupedal bridge, the superstructure does
not terminate (as it did in our former diagram) at the two points
of support, but it extends beyond them at each end, carrying the
head at one end and the tail at the other, upon a pair of projecting
arms or “cantilevers” (Fig. <a href="#fig346" title="go to Fig. 346">346</a>).</p>

<p>In a typical cantilever bridge, such as the Forth Bridge
(Fig. <a href="#fig345" title="go to Fig. 345">345</a>), a certain simplification is introduced. For each pier
carries, in this case, its own double-armed cantilever, linked by
a short connecting girder to the next, but so jointed to it that no
weight is transmitted from one cantilever to another. The bridge
in short is <i>cut</i> into separate sections, practically independent of
one another; at the joints a certain amount of bending is not
precluded, but shearing strain is evaded; and each pier carries
only its own load. By this arrangement the engineer finds that
design and construction are alike simplified and facilitated. In
the case of the horse, it is obvious that the two piers of the bridge,
that is to say the fore-legs and the hind-legs, do not bear (as they
do in the Forth Bridge) separate and independent loads, but the
whole system forms a continuous structure. In this case, the
calculation of the loads will be a little more difficult and the
cor­re­spon­ding design of the structure a little more complicated.
We shall accordingly simplify our problem very considerably if,
to begin with, we look upon the quadrupedal skeleton as constituted
of two separate systems, that is to say of two balanced
cantilevers, one supported on the fore-legs and the other on the
hind; and we may deal afterwards with the fact that these two
cantilevers are not independent, but are bound up in one common
field of force and plan of construction.</p>

<p>In the horse it is plain that the two cantilever systems into
which we may thus analyse the quadrupedal bridge are unequal
in magnitude and importance. The fore-part of the animal is
much bulkier than its hind quarters, and the fact that the fore-legs
carry, as they so evidently do, a greater weight than the hind-legs
has long been known and is easily proved; we have only to walk
a horse onto a weigh-bridge, weigh first his fore-legs and then his
hind-legs, to discover that what we may call his
front half weighs <span class="xxpn" id="p695">{695}</span>
a good deal more than what is carried on his hind feet, say about
three-fifths of the whole weight of the animal.</p>

<p>The great (or anterior) cantilever then, in the horse, is constituted
by the heavy head and still heavier neck on one side of
the pier which is represented by the fore-legs, and by the dorsal
vertebrae carrying a large part of the weight of the trunk upon
the other side; and this weight is so balanced over the fore-legs
that the cantilever, while “anchored” to the other parts of the
structure, transmits but little of its weight to the hind-legs, and
the amount so transmitted will vary with the position of the
head and with the position of any artificial load<a class="afnanch" href="#fn627" id="fnanch627">627</a>.
Under certain
conditions, as when the head is thrust well forward, it is evident
that the hind-legs will be actually relieved of a portion of the
comparatively small load which is their normal share.</p>

<p>Our problem now is to discover, in a rough and ap­prox­i­mate
way, some of the structural details which the balanced load upon
the double cantilever will impress upon the fabric.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Working by the methods of graphic statics, the engineer’s
task is, in theory, one of great simplicity. He begins by drawing
in outline the structure which he desires to erect; he calculates
the stresses and bending-moments necessitated by the dimensions
and load on the structure; he draws a new diagram representing
these forces, and he designs and builds his fabric on the lines of this
statical diagram. He does, in short, precisely what we have seen
<i>nature</i> doing in the case of the bone. For if we had begun, as
it were, by blocking out the femur roughly, and considering its
position and dimensions, its means of support and the load which
it has to bear, we could have proceeded at once to draw the system
of stress-lines which must occupy the field of force: and to
precisely these stress-lines has nature kept in the building of the
bone, down to the minute arrangement of its trabeculae.</p>

<p>The essential function of a bridge is to stretch across a certain
span, and carry a certain definite load; and
this being so, the <span class="xxpn" id="p696">{696}</span>
chief problem in the designing of a bridge is to provide due
resistance to the “bending-moments” which result from the load.
These bending-moments will vary from point to point along the
girder, and taking the simplest case of a uniform load supported
at both ends, they will be represented by points on a parabola.
If the girder be of uniform depth, that is to say if its two flanges,</p>

<p class="pcontinue">respectively under tension and compression, be parallel to one
another, then the stress upon these flanges will vary as the bending-moments,
and will accordingly be very severe in the middle and
will dwindle towards the ends. But if we make the <i>depth</i> of the
girder everywhere proportional to the bending-moments, that is</p>

<img src="images/i696b.png" width="528" height="247" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 341. The bridge constructed, as a
 parabolic girder.</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">to say if we copy in the girder the outlines of the bending-moment
diagram, then our design will automatically meet the circumstances
of the case, for the horizontal stress in each flange will
now be uniform throughout the length of the
girder. In short, in <span class="xxpn" id="p697">{697}</span>
Professor Fidler’s words, “Every diagram of moments represents
the outline of a framed structure which will carry the given load
with a uniform horizontal stress in the principal members.”</p>

<div class="dright dwth-d" id="fig342">
<img src="images/i697.png" width="384" height="230" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 342.</div></div>

<p>In the following diagrams (Fig. <a href="#fig342" title="go to Fig. 342">342</a>, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) (which are taken
from the original ones of Culmann),
we see at once that the
loaded beam or bracket (<i>a</i>) has
a “danger-point” close to its
fixed base, that is to say at the
point remotest from its load.
But in the parabolic bracket
(<i>b</i>) there is no danger-point at
all, for the dimensions of the
structure are made to increase <i>pari passu</i> with the bending-moments:
stress and resistance vary together. Again in Fig. <a href="#fig340" title="go to Fig. 340">340</a>,
we have a simple span (A), with its stress diagram (B); and in
Fig. <a href="#fig341" title="go to Fig. 341">341</a> we have the cor­re­spon­ding parabolic girder, whose
stresses are now uniform throughout. In fact we see that, by a
process of conversion, the stress diagram in each case becomes
the structural diagram in the other<a class="afnanch" href="#fn629" id="fnanch629">629</a>.
Now all this is but the
modern rendering of one of Galileo’s most famous propositions.
In the Dialogue which we have already quoted more than once<a class="afnanch" href="#fn630" id="fnanch630">630</a>,
Sagredo says “It would be a fine thing if one could discover the
proper shape to give a solid in order to make it equally resistant
at every point, in which case a load placed at the middle would
not produce fracture more easily than if placed at any other
point.” And Galileo (in the person of Salviati) first puts the
problem into its more general form; and then shews us how, by
giving a parabolic outline to our beam, we have its simple and
comprehensive solution.<br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<p>In the case of our cantilever bridge, we shew
the primitive girder <span class="xxpn" id="p698">{698}</span>
in Fig. <a href="#fig343" title="go to Fig. 343">343</a>, A, with its bending-moment diagram (B); and it is
evident that, if we turn this diagram upside down, it will still be
illustrative, just as before, of the bending-moments from point
to point: for as yet it is merely a diagram, or graph, of relative
magnitudes.</p>

<p>To either of these two stress diagrams, direct or inverted, we
may fit the design of the construction, as in Figs. <a href="#fig343" title="go to Fig. 343">343</a>, C and 344.</p>

<p>Now in different animals the amount and distribution of the
load differs so greatly that we can expect no single diagram,
drawn from the comparative anatomy of bridges, to apply equally
well to all the cases met with in the comparative anatomy of
quadrupeds; but nevertheless we have already gained an insight
into the general principles of “structural design” in the quadrupedal
bridge.</p>

<p>In our last diagram the upper member of the
cantilever is under <span class="xxpn" id="p699">{699}</span>
tension; it is represented in the quadruped by the <i>ligamentum
nuchae</i> on the one side of the cantilever, and by the supraspinous
ligaments of the dorsal vertebrae on the other. The compression
member is similarly represented, on both sides of the cantilever,
by the vertebral column, or rather by the <i>bodies</i> of the vertebrae;
while the web, or “filling,” of the girders, that is to say the upright
or sloping members which extend from one flange to the other, is
represented on the one hand by the spines of the vertebrae, and
on the other hand, by the oblique interspinous ligaments and
muscles. The high spines over the quadruped’s withers are no
other than the high struts which rise over the supporting piers
in the parabolic girder, and correspond to the position of the
maximal bending-moments. The fact that these tall vertebrae
of the withers usually slope backwards, sometimes steeply, in
a quadruped, is easily and obviously explained<a class="afnanch" href="#fn631" id="fnanch631">631</a>.
For each
vertebra tends to act as a “hinged lever,” and its spine, acted
on by the tensions transmitted by the ligaments on either side,
takes up its position as the diagonal of the parallelogram of
forces to which it is exposed.</p>

<p>It happens that in these comparatively simple types of
cantilever bridge the whole of the parabolic curvature is transferred
to one or other of the principal members, either the
tension-member or the compression-member as the case may be.
But it is of course equally permissible to have both members
curved, in opposite directions. This, though not exactly the case
in the Forth Bridge, is ap­prox­i­mate­ly so; for here the main
compression-member is curved or arched, and the main tension-member
slopes downwards on either side from its maximal height
above the piers. In short, the Forth Bridge is a nearer approach
than either of the other cantilever bridges
which we have <span class="xxpn" id="p700">{700}</span>
illustrated to the plan of the quadrupedal skeleton; for the main
compression-member almost exactly recalls the form of the vertebral
column, while the main tension-member, though not so
closely similar to the supraspinous and nuchal ligaments, corresponds
to the plan of these in a somewhat simplified form.</p>

 <div class="pcaption">Fig. 345. A two-armed cantilever of the
Forth Bridge. Thick lines, compression-members (bones);
thin lines, tension-members (ligaments).</div></div>

<p>We may now pass without difficulty from the two-armed
cantilever supported on a single pier, as it is in each separate
section of the Forth Bridge, or as we have imagined it to be in
the forequarters of a horse, to the condition which actually exists
in that quadruped, where a two-armed cantilever has its load
distributed over two separate piers. This is not precisely what
an engineer calls a “continuous” girder, for that term is applied
to a girder which, as a continuous structure, crosses two or more
spans, while here there is only one. But nevertheless, this girder</p>

<div class="dctr02" id="fig346">
<img src="images/i700b.png" width="704" height="270" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 346.</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">is <i>effectively</i> continuous from the head to the tip of the tail; and
at each point of support (<i>A</i> and <i>B</i>) it is subjected to the negative
bending-moment due to the overhanging load on each of the
projecting cantilever arms <i>AH</i> and <i>BT</i>. The diagram of bending-moments
will (according to the ordinary
conventions) lie below <span class="xxpn" id="p701">{701}</span>
the base line (because the moments are negative), and must take
some such form as that shown in the diagram: for the girder
must suffer its greatest bending stress not at the centre, but at
the two points of support <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, where the moments are
measured by the vertical ordinates. It is plain that this figure
only differs from a representation of <i>two</i> independent two-armed
cantilevers in the fact that there is no point midway in the span
where the bending-moment vanishes, but only a region between
the two piers in which its magnitude tends to diminish.</p>

<p>The diagram effects a graphic summation of the positive and
negative moments, but its form may assume various modifications
according to the method of graphic summation which we may
choose to adopt; and it is obvious also that the form of the
diagram may assume many modifications of detail according to
the actual distribution of the load. In all cases the essential
points to be observed are these: firstly that the girder which is</p>

<div class="dctr04" id="fig347">
<img src="images/i701.png" width="528" height="124" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 347. Stress-diagram of horse’s backbone.</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">
to resist the bending-moments induced by the load must possess
its two principal members—an upper tension-member or tie,
represented by ligament, and a lower compression-member
represented by bone: these members being united by a web
represented by the vertebral spines with their interspinous ligaments,
and being placed one above the other in the order named
because the moments are negative; secondly we observe that the
depth of the web, or distance apart of the principal members,—that
is to say the height of the vertebral spines,—must be proportional
to the bending-moment at each point along the length
of the girder.</p>

<p>In the case of an animal carrying two-thirds of his weight
upon his fore-legs and only one-third upon his hind-legs, the
bending-moment diagram will be unsymmetrical, after the fashion
of Fig. <a href="#fig347" title="go to Fig. 347">347</a>, the vertical ordinate at <i>A</i> being thrice the height of
that at <i>B</i>. <span class="xxpn" id="p702">{702}</span></p>

<p>On the other hand the Dinosaur, with his light head and
enormous tail would give us a moment-diagram with the opposite
kind of asymmetry, the greatest bending stress being now found
over the haunches, at <i>B</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig348" title="go to Fig. 348">348</a>). A glance at the skeleton of
<i>Diplodocus Carnegii</i> will shew us the high vertebral spines over
the loins, in precise cor­re­spon­dence with the requirements of this
diagram: just as in the horse, under the opposite conditions of
load, the highest vertebral spines are those of the withers, that
is to say those of the posterior cervical and anterior dorsal
vertebrae.</p>

<img src="images/i702.png" width="704" height="143" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 348. Stress-diagram of backbone

<p>We have now not only dealt with the general resemblance,
both in structure and in function, of the quadrupedal backbone
with its associated ligaments to a double-armed cantilever girder,
but we have begun to see how the characters of the vertebral
system must differ in different quadrupeds, according to the
conditions imposed by the varying distribution of the load: and
in particular how the height of the vertebral spines which constitute
the web will be in a definite relation, as regards magnitude
and position, to the bending-moments induced thereby. We
should require much detailed information as to the actual weights
of the several parts of the body before we could follow out
quantitatively the mechanical efficiency of each type of skeleton;
but in an ap­prox­i­mate way what we have already learnt will
enable us to trace many interesting correspondences between
structure and function in this particular part of comparative
anatomy. We must, however, be careful to note that the great
cantilever system is not of necessity constituted by the vertical
column and its ligaments alone, but that the pelvis, firmly united
as it is to the sacral vertebrae, and stretching backwards far
beyond the acetabulum, becomes an intrinsic part of the system;
and helping (as it does) to carry the load of
the abdominal viscera, <span class="xxpn" id="p703">{703}</span>
constitutes a great portion of the posterior cantilever arm, or
even its chief portion in cases where the size and weight of the
tail are insignificant, as is the case in the majority of terrestrial
mammals.</p>

<p>We may also note here, that just as a bridge is often a
“combined” or composite structure, exhibiting a combination of
principles in its construction, so in the quadruped we have, as
it were, another girder supported by the same piers to carry the
viscera; and consisting of an inverted parabolic girder, whose
compression-member is again constituted by the backbone, its
tension-member by the line of the sternum and the abdominal
muscles, while the ribs and intercostal muscles play the part of
the web or filling.</p>

<p>A very few instances must suffice to illustrate the chief
variations in the load, and therefore in the bending-moment
diagram, and therefore also in the plan of construction, of various
quadrupeds. But let us begin by setting forth, in a few cases,
the actual weights which are borne by the fore-limbs and the
hind-limbs, in our quadrupedal bridge<a class="afnanch" href="#fn632" id="fnanch632">632</a>.</p>

<p>It will be observed that in all these animals the load upon the
fore-feet preponderates considerably over that upon the hind, the
preponderance being rather greater in the elephant than in the
horse, and markedly greater in the camel and the llama than in
the other two. But while these weights are helpful and suggestive,
it is obvious that they do not go nearly far enough to
give us a full insight into the constructional diagram to which
the animals are conformed. For such a
purpose we should <span class="xxpn" id="p704">{704}</span>
require to weigh the total load, not in two portions, but in many;
and we should also have to take close account of the general form
of the animal, of the relation between that form and the distribution
of the load, and of the actual directions of each bone and
ligament by which the forces of compression and tension were
transmitted. All this lies beyond us for the present; but nevertheless
we may consider, very briefly, the principal cases involved
in our enquiry, of which the above animals form only a partial
and preliminary illustration.</p>

<ul><li>
<p>(1) Wherever we have a heavily loaded anterior cantilever
arm, that is to say whenever the head and neck represent a
considerable fraction of the whole weight of the body, we tend
to have large bending-moments over the fore-legs, and correspondingly
high spines over the vertebrae of the withers. This</p>

<div class="dctr02" id="fig349">
<img src="images/i704.png" width="704" height="208" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 349. Stress-diagram of
 Titanotherium.</div></div>

<p class="pcontinue">
is the case in the great majority of four-footed, terrestrial animals,
the chief exceptions being found in animals with comparatively
small heads but large and heavy tails, such as the anteaters or
the Dinosaurian reptiles, and also (very naturally) in animals
such as the crocodile, where the “bridge” can scarcely be said
to be developed, for the long heavy body sags down to rest upon
the ground. The case is sufficiently exemplified by the horse,
and still more notably by the stag, the ox, or the pig. It is
illustrated in the accompanying diagram of the conditions in the
great extinct Titanotherium.</p></li>

<li><p>(2) In the elephant and the camel we have similar conditions,
but slightly modified. In both cases, and especially in the latter,
the weight on the fore-quarters is relatively large; and in both
cases the bending-moments are all the larger, by reason of the
length and forward extension of the camel’s neck,
and the forward <span class="xxpn" id="p705">{705}</span>
position of the heavy tusks of the elephant. In both cases the
dorsal spines are large, but they do not strike us as exceptionally
so; but in both cases, and especially in the elephant, they slope
backwards in a marked degree. Each spine, as already explained,
must in all cases assume the position of the diagonal in the
parallelogram of forces defined by the tensions acting on it at
its extremity; for it constitutes a “hinged lever,” by which the
bending-moments on either side are automatically balanced; and
it is plain that the more the spine slopes backwards the more it
indicates a relatively large strain thrown upon the great ligament
of the neck, and a relief of strain upon the more directly acting,
but weaker, ligaments of the back and loins. In both cases, the
bending-moments would seem to be more evenly distributed over
the region of the back than, for instance, in the stag, with its
light hind-quarters and heavy load of antlers: and in both cases
the high “girder” is considerably prolonged, by an extension of
the tall spines backwards in the direction of the loins. When
we come to such a case as the mammoth, with its immensely
heavy and immensely elongated tusks, we perceive at once that
the bending-moments over the fore-legs are now very severe;
and we see also that the dorsal spines in this region are much
more conspicuously elevated than in the ordinary elephant.</p></li>

<li><p>(3) In the case of the giraffe we have, without doubt, a very
heavy load upon the fore-legs, though no weighings are at hand
to define the ratio; but as far as possible this disproportionate
load would seem to be relieved, by help of a downward as well
as backward thrust, through the sloping back, to the unusually
low hind-quarters. The dorsal spines of the vertebrae are very
high and strong, and the whole girder-system very perfectly
formed. The elevated, rather than protruding position of the
head lessens the anterior bending-moment as far as possible; but
it leads to a strong compressional stress transmitted almost
directly downwards through the neck: in correlation with which
we observe that the bodies of the cervical vertebrae are exceptionally
large and strong and steadily increase in size and strength
from the head downwards.</p></li>

<li><p>(4) In the kangaroo, the fore-limbs are entirely relieved of
their load, and accordingly the tall spines over
the withers, which <span class="xxpn" id="p706">{706}</span>
were so conspicuous in all heavy-headed <i>quadrupeds</i>, have now
completely vanished. The creature has become bipedal, and body
and tail form the extremities of <i>a single</i> balanced cantilever,
whose maximal bending-moments are marked by strong, high
lumbar and sacral vertebrae, and by iliac bones of peculiar form
and exceptional strength.</p>

<p>Precisely the same condition is illustrated in the Iguanodon,
and better still by reason of the great bulk of the creature, and of
the heavy load which falls to be supported by the great cantilever
and by the hind-legs which form its piers. The long and heavy
body and neck require a balance-weight (as in the kangaroo) in
the form of a long heavy tail. And the double-armed cantilever,
so constituted, shews a beautiful parabolic curvature in the graded
heights of the whole series of vertebral spines, which rise to a
maximum over the haunches and die away slowly towards the
neck and the tip of the tail.</p></li>

<li><p>(5) In the case of some of the great American fossil reptiles,
such as Diplodocus, it has always been a more or less disputed
question whether or not they assumed, like Iguanodon, an erect,
bipedal attitude. In all of these we see an elongated pelvis, and,
in still more marked degree, we see elevated spinous processes of
the vertebrae over the hind-limbs; in all of them we have a long
heavy tail, and in most of them we have a marked reduction in
size and weight both of the fore-limb and of the head itself. The
great size of these animals is not of itself a proof against the erect
attitude; because it might well have been accompanied by an
aquatic or partially submerged habitat, and the crushing stress of
the creature’s huge bulk proportionately relieved. But we must
consider each such case in the whole light of its own evidence;
and it is easy to see that, just as the quadrupedal mammal may
carry the greater part but not all of its weight upon its fore-limbs,
so a heavy-tailed reptile may carry the greater part upon its hind-limbs,
without this process going so far as to relieve its fore-limbs
of all weight whatsoever. This would seem to be the case in such
a form as Diplodocus, and also in Stegosaurus, whose restoration
by Marsh is doubtless substantially correct<a class="afnanch" href="#fn633" id="fnanch633">633</a>.
The fore-limbs, <span class="xxpn" id="p707">{707}</span>
though comparatively small, are obviously fashioned for support,
but the weight which they have to carry is far less than that
which the hind-limbs bear. The head is small and the neck
short, while on the other hand the hind-quarters and the tail are
big and massive. The backbone bends into a great, double-armed
cantilever, culminating over the pelvis and the hind-limbs, and
here furnished with its highest and strongest spines to separate
the tension-member from the compression-member of the girder.
The fore-legs form a secondary supporting pier to this great
cantilever, the greater part of whose weight is poised upon the
hind-limbs alone.</p>

<div class="dctr02" id="fig350">
<img src="images/i707.png" width="704" height="338" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 350. Diagram of Stegosaurus.</div></div>
</li>

<li><p>(6) In a bird, such as an ostrich or a common fowl, the
bipedal habit necessitates the balancing of the load upon a single
double-armed cantilever-girder, just as in the Iguanodon and the
kangaroo, but the construction is effected in a somewhat different
way. The great heavy tail has entirely disappeared; but, though
from the skeleton alone it would seem that nearly all the bulk of
the animal lay in front of the hind-limbs, yet in the living bird
we can easily perceive that the great weight of the abdominal
organs lies suspended <i>behind</i> the socket for the thigh-bone, and
so hangs from the posterior lever-arm of the cantilever, balancing
the head and neck and thorax whose combined
weight hangs from <span class="xxpn" id="p708">{708}</span>
the anterior arm. The great cantilever girder appears, accordingly,
balanced over the hind-legs. It is now constituted in part by
the posterior dorsal or lumbar vertebrae, all traces of special
elevation having disappeared from the anterior dorsals; but the
greater part of the girder is made up of the great iliac bones,
placed side by side, and gripping firmly the sacral vertebrae, often
almost to the extinction of these latter. In the form of these
iliac bones, the arched curvature of their upper border, in their
elongation fore-and-aft to overhang both ways their supporting
pier, and in the coincidence of their greatest height with the
median line of support over the centre of gravity, we recognise
all the char­ac­ter­is­tic properties of the typical balanced
cantilever<a class="afnanch" href="#fn634" id="fnanch634">634</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>(7) We find a highly important corollary in the case of
aquatic animals. For here the effect of gravity is neutralised;
we have neither piers nor cantilevers; and we find accordingly
in all aquatic mammals of whatsoever group—whales, seals or
sea-cows—that the high arched vertebral spines over the withers,
or cor­re­spon­ding structures over the hind-limbs, have both
entirely disappeared.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Just as the cantilever girder tended to become obsolete in the
aquatic mammal so does it tend to weaken and disappear in the
aquatic bird. There is a very marked contrast between the high-arched
strongly-built pelvis in the ostrich or the hen, and the
long, thin, comparatively straight and weakly bone which represents
it in a diver, a grebe or a penguin.</p>

<p>But in the aquatic mammal, such as a whale or a dolphin (and
not less so in the aquatic bird), <i>stiffness</i> must be ensured in order
to enable the muscles to act against the resistance of the water
in the act of swimming; and accordingly nature must provide
against bending-moments irrespective of gravity. In the dolphin,
at any rate as regards its tail end, the conditions will be not very
different from those of a column or beam with fixed ends, in
which, under deflexion, there will be two points of contrary
flexure, as at <i>C</i>, <i>D</i>, in Fig. <a href="#fig351" title="go to Fig. 351">351</a>. <span class="xxpn" id="p709">{709}</span></p>

<div class="dright dwth-e" id="fig351">
<img src="images/i709.png" width="384" height="109" alt="" />
 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 351.</div></div>

<p>Here, between <i>C</i> and <i>D</i> we have a varying bending-moment,
represented by a continuous curve with its maximal elevation
midway between the points of inflexion. And correspondingly,
in our dolphin, we have a continuous
series of high dorsal
spines, rising to a maximum
about the middle of the animal’s
body, and falling to nil at some
distance from the end of the tail. It is their business (as
usual) to keep the tension-member, represented by the strong
supraspinous ligaments, wide apart from the compression-member,
which is as usual represented by the backbone itself. But in
our diagram we see that on the further side of <i>C</i> and <i>D</i> we
have a <i>negative</i> curve of bending-moments, or bending-moments
in a contrary direction. Without inquiring how these stresses
are precisely met towards the dolphin’s head (where the coalesced
cervical vertebrae suggest themselves as a partial explanation),
we see at once that towards the tail they are met by the strong
series of chevron-bones, which in the caudal region, where tall
<i>dorsal</i> spines are no longer needed, take their place <i>below</i> the
vertebrae, in precise cor­re­spon­dence with the bending-moment
diagram. In many cases other than these aquatic ones, when
we have to deal with animals with long and heavy tails (like the
Iguanodon and the kangaroo of which we have already spoken),
we are apt to meet with similar, though usually shorter chevron-bones;
and in all these cases we may see without difficulty that
a negative bending-moment is there to be resisted. <br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<p>In the dolphin we may find a good illustration of the fact
that not only is it necessary to provide for rigidity in the vertical
direction, but also in the horizontal, where a tendency to bending
must be resisted on either side. This function is effected in part
by the ribs with their associated muscles, but they extend but a
little way and their efficacy for this purpose can be but small.
We have, however, behind the region of the ribs and on either side
of the backbone a strong series of elongated and flattened transverse
processes, forming a web for the support of a tension-member
in the usual form of ligament, and so playing a part precisely
analogous to that performed by the dorsal spines
in the same <span class="xxpn" id="p710">{710}</span>
animal. In an ordinary fish, such as a cod or a haddock, we see
precisely the same thing: the backbone is stiffened by the indispensable
help of its <i>three series</i> of ligament-connected processes,
the dorsal and the two transverse series. And here we see (as
we see partly also among the whales), that these three series of
processes, or struts, tend to be arranged well-nigh at equal angles,
of 120°, with one another, giving the greatest and most uniform
strength of which such a system is capable. On the other hand,
in a flat fish, such as a plaice, where from the natural mode of
progression it is necessary that the backbone should be flexible
in one direction while stiffened in another, we find the whole
outline of the fish comparable to that of a double bowstring
girder, the compression-member being (as usual) the backbone,
the tension-member on either side being constituted by the interspinous
ligaments and muscles, while the web or filling is very
beautifully represented by the long and evenly graded spines,
which spring symmetrically from opposite sides of each individual
vertebra.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The main result at which we have now arrived, in regard to
the construction of the vertebral column and its associated parts,
is that we may look upon it as a certain type of <i>girder</i>, whose depth,
as we cannot help seeing, is everywhere very nearly proportional
to the height of the cor­re­spon­ding ordinate in the diagram of
moments: just as it is in the girder of a cantilever bridge as
designed by a modern engineer. In short, after the nineteenth
or twentieth century engineer has done his best in framing the
design of a big cantilever, he may find that some of his best ideas
bad, so to speak, been anticipated ages ago in the fabric of the
great saurians and the larger mammals.</p>

<p>But it is possible that the modern engineer might be disposed
to criticise the skeleton girder at two or three points; and in
particular he might think the girder, as we see it for instance in
Diplodocus or Stegosaurus, not deep enough for carrying the
animal’s enormous weight of some twenty tons. If we adopt a
much greater depth (or ratio of depth to length) as in the modern
cantilever, we shall greatly increase the <i>strength</i> of the structure;
but at the same time we should greatly increase
its <i>rigidity</i>, and <span class="xxpn" id="p711">{711}</span>
this is precisely what, in the circumstances of the case, it would
seem that nature is bound to avoid. We need not suppose that
the great saurian was by any means active and limber; but a
certain amount of activity and flexibility he was bound to have,
and in a thousand ways he would find the need of a backbone
that should be <i>flexible</i> as well as <i>strong</i>. Now this opens up a
new aspect of the matter and is the beginning of a long, long story,
for in every direction this double requirement of strength and
flexibility imposes new conditions upon our design. To represent
all the correlated quantities we should have to construct not only
a diagram of moments but also a diagram of elastic deflexion and
its so-called “curvature”; and the engineer would want to know
something more about the <i>material</i> of the ligamentous tension-member—its
modulus of elasticity in direct tension, its elastic
limit, and its safe working stress.</p>

<p>In various ways our structural problem is beset by “limiting
conditions.” Not only must rigidity be associated with flexibility,
but also stability must be ensured in various positions and
attitudes; and the primary function of support or weight-carrying
must be combined with the provision of <i>points d’appui</i> for the
muscles concerned in locomotion. We cannot hope to arrive at
a numerical or quantitative solution of this complicate problem,
but we have found it possible to trace it out in part towards a
qualitative solution. And speaking broadly we may certainly
say that in each case the problem has been solved by nature
herself, very much as she solves the difficult problems of minimal
areas in a system of soap-bubbles; so that each animal is fitted
with a backbone adapted to his own individual needs, or (in
other words) cor­re­spon­ding exactly to the mean resultant of the
stresses to which as a mechanical system it is exposed.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Throughout this short discussion of the principles of construction,
limited to one part of the skeleton, we see the same
general principles at work which we recognise in the plan and
construction of an individual bone. That is to say, we see a
tendency for material to be laid down just in the lines of <i>stress</i>,
and so as to evade thereby the distortions and disruptions due to
<i>shear</i>. In these phenomena there lies a definite
law of growth, <span class="xxpn" id="p712">{712}</span>
whatever its ultimate expression or explanation may come to be.
Let us not press either argument or hypothesis too far: but be
content to see that skeletal form, as brought about by growth,
is to a very large extent determined by mechanical con­si­de­ra­tions,
and tends to manifest itself as a diagram, or reflected image, of
mechanical stress. If we fail, owing to the immense complexity
of the case, to unravel all the math­e­mat­i­cal principles involved
in the construction of the skeleton, we yet gain something, and
not a little, by applying this method to the familiar objects of our
anatomical study: <i>obvia conspicimus, nubem pellente mathesi</i><a class="afnanch" href="#fn635" id="fnanch635">635</a>.</p>

<p>Before we leave this subject of mechanical adaptation, let us
dwell once more for a moment upon the con­si­de­ra­tions which
arise from our conception of a field of force, or field of stress, in
which tension and compression (for instance) are inevitably
combined, and are met by the materials naturally fitted to resist
them. It has been remarked over and over again how harmoniously
the whole organism hangs together, and how throughout
its fabric one part is related and fitted to another in strictly
functional correlation. But this conception, though never denied,
is sometimes apt to be forgotten in the course of that process of
more and more minute analysis by which, for simplicity’s sake,
we seek to unravel the intricacies of a complex organism.</p>

<p>We tend, as we analyse a thing into its parts or into its
properties, to magnify these, to exaggerate their apparent
independence, and to hide from ourselves (at least for a time) the
essential integrity and individuality of the composite whole. We
divide the body into its organs, the skeleton into its bones, as
in very much the same fashion we make a subjective analysis of
the mind, according to the teachings of psychology, into component
factors: but we know very well that judgment and knowledge,
courage or gentleness, love or fear, have no separate existence,
but are somehow mere manifestations, or imaginary co-efficients,
of a most complex integral. And likewise, as biologists, we may
go so far as to say that even the bones themselves are only in a
limited and even a deceptive sense, separate and individual
things. The skeleton begins as a <i>continuum</i>, and a <i>continuum</i> it
remains all life long. The things that link
bone with bone, <span class="xxpn" id="p713">{713}</span>
cartilage, ligaments, membranes, are fashioned out of the same
primordial tissue, and come into being <i>pari passu</i>, with the bones
themselves. The entire fabric has its soft parts and its hard, its
rigid and its flexible parts; but until we disrupt and dismember
its bony, gristly and fibrous parts, one from another, it exists
simply as a “skeleton,” as one integral and individual whole.</p>

<p>A bridge was once upon a time a loose heap of pillars and rods
and rivets of steel. But the identity of these is lost, just as if
they were fused into a solid mass, when once the bridge is built;
their separate functions are only to be recognised and analysed
in so far as we can analyse the stresses, the tensions and the
pressures, which affect this part of the structure or that; and
these forces are not themselves separate entities, but are the
resultants of an analysis of the whole field of force. Moreover
when the bridge is broken it is no longer a bridge, and all its
strength is gone. So is it precisely with the skeleton. In it is
reflected a field of force: and keeping pace, as it were, in action
and interaction with this field of force, the whole skeleton and
every part thereof, down to the minute intrinsic structure of the
bones themselves, is related in form and in position to the lines
of force, to the resistances it has to encounter; for by one of
the mysteries of biology, resistance begets resistance, and where
pressure falls there growth springs up in strength to meet it.
And, pursuing the same train of thought, we see that all this is
true not of the skeleton alone but of the whole fabric of the body.
Muscle and bone, for instance, are inseparably associated and
connected; they are moulded one with another; they come into
being together, and act and react together<a class="afnanch" href="#fn636" id="fnanch636">636</a>.
We may study
them apart, but it is as a concession to our weakness and to the
narrow outlook of our minds. We see, dimly perhaps, but yet
with all the assurance of conviction, that between muscle and
bone there can be no change in the one but it is correlated with
changes in the other; that through and through they are linked
in indissoluble association; that they are
only separate entities <span class="xxpn" id="p714">{714}</span>
in this limited and subordinate sense, that they are <i>parts</i> of a
whole which, when it loses its composite integrity, ceases to
exist.</p>

<p>The biologist, as well as the philosopher, learns to recognise
that the whole is not merely the sum of its parts. It is this, and
much more than this. For it is not a bundle of parts but an
organisation of parts, of parts in their mutual arrangement,
fitting one with another, in what Aristotle calls “a single and
indivisible principle of unity”; and this is no merely metaphysical
conception, but is in biology the fundamental truth which lies at
the basis of Geoffroy’s (or Goethe’s) law of “compensation,” or
“balancement of growth.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless Darwin found no difficulty in believing that
“natural selection will tend in the long run to reduce <i>any part</i>
of the organisation, as soon as, through changed habits, it becomes
superfluous: without by any means causing some other part to
be largely developed in a cor­re­spon­ding degree. And conversely,
that natural selection may perfectly well succeed in largely developing
an organ without requiring as a necessary compensation
the reduction of some adjoining part<a class="afnanch" href="#fn637" id="fnanch637">637</a>.”
This view has been
developed into a doctrine of the “independence of single characters”
(not to be confused with the germinal “unit characters”
of Mendelism), especially by the palaeontologists. Thus Osborn
asserts a “principle of hereditary correlation,” combined with a
“principle of <i>hereditary separability</i> whereby the body is a colony,
a mosaic, of single individual and separable characters<a class="afnanch" href="#fn638" id="fnanch638">638</a>.”
I cannot think that there is more than a small element of truth
in this doctrine. As Kant said, “die Ursache der Art der Existenz
bei jedem Theile eines lebenden Körpers <i>ist im Ganzen enthalten</i>.”
And, according to the trend or aspect of our thought, we may
look upon the co-ordinated parts, now as related and fitted <i>to the
end or function</i> of the whole, and now as related to or resulting
<i>from the physical causes</i> inherent in the entire system of forces
to which the whole has been exposed, and under whose influence
it has come into being<a class="afnanch" href="#fn639" id="fnanch639">639</a>.
<span class="xxpn" id="p715">{715}</span></p>

<p>It would seem to me that the mechanical principles and
phenomena which we have dealt with in this chapter are of no small
importance to the morphologist, all the more when he is inclined
to direct his study of the skeleton exclusively to the problem of
phylogeny; and especially when, according to the methods of
modern comparative morphology, he is apt to take the skeleton
to pieces, and to draw from the comparison of a series of scapulae,
humeri, or individual vertebrae, conclusions as to the descent
and relationship of the animals to which they belong.</p>

<p>It would, I dare say, be a gross exaggeration to see in every
bone nothing more than a resultant of immediate and direct
physical or mechanical conditions; for to do so would be to deny
the existence, in this connection, of a principle of heredity. And
though I have tried throughout this book to lay emphasis on the
direct action of causes other than heredity, in short to circumscribe
the employment of the latter as a working hypothesis in
morphology, there can still be no question whatsoever but that
heredity is a vastly important as well as a mysterious thing; it
is one of the great factors in biology, however we may attempt to
figure to ourselves, or howsoever we may fail even to imagine,
its underlying physical explanation. But I maintain that it is
no less an exaggeration if we tend to neglect these direct physical
and mechanical modes of causation altogether, and to see in the
characters of a bone merely the results of variation and of heredity,
and to trust, in consequence, to those characters as a sure and
certain and unquestioned guide to affinity and phylogeny.
Comparative anatomy has its physiological side, which filled
men’s minds in John Hunter’s day, and in Owen’s
day; it has its <span class="xxpn" id="p716">{716}</span>
clas­si­fi­ca­tory and phylogenetic aspect, which has all but filled
men’s minds during the last couple of generations; and we can
lose sight of neither aspect without risk of error and misconception.</p>

<p>It is certain that the question of phylogeny, always difficult,
becomes especially so in cases where a great change of physical
or mechanical conditions has come about, and where accordingly
the physical and physiological factors in connection with change
of form are bound to be large. To discuss these questions at
length would be to enter on a discussion of Lamarck’s philosophy
of biology, and of many other things besides. But let us take
one single illustration.</p>

<p>The affinities of the whales constitute, as will be readily
admitted, a very hard problem in phylogenetic clas­si­fi­ca­tion.
We know now that the extinct Zeuglodons are related to the
old Creodont carnivores, and thereby (though distantly) to the
seals; and it is supposed, but it is by no means so certain, that
in turn they are to be considered as representing, or as allied to,
the ancestors of the modern toothed whales<a class="afnanch" href="#fn640" id="fnanch640">640</a>.
The proof of any
such a contention becomes, to my mind, extraordinarily difficult
and complicated; and the arguments commonly used in such cases
may be said (in Bacon’s phrase) to allure, rather than to extort
assent. Though the Zeuglodonts were aquatic animals, we do not
know, and we have no right to suppose or to assume, that they
swam after the fashion of a whale (any more than the seal does),
that they dived like a whale, and leaped like a whale. But the fact
that the whale does these things, and the way in which he does
them, is reflected in many parts of his skeleton—perhaps more
or less in all: so much so that the lines of stress which these
actions impose are the very plan and working-diagram of great
part of his structure. That the Zeuglodon has a scapula like that
of a whale is to my mind no necessary argument that he is akin
by blood-relationship to a whale: that his dorsal vertebrae are
very different from a whale’s is no conclusive
argument that <span class="xxpn" id="p717">{717}</span>
such blood-relationship is lacking. The former fact goes a long
way to prove that he used his flippers very much as a whale does;
the latter goes still farther to prove that his general movements
and equi­lib­rium in the water were totally different. The whale
may be descended from the Carnivora, or might for that matter,
as an older school of naturalists believed, be descended from the
Ungulates; but whether or no, we need not expect to find in him
the scapula, the pelvis or the vertebral column of the lion or of
the cow, for it would be physically impossible that he could live
the life he does with any one of them. In short, when we hope to
find the missing links between a whale and his terrestrial ancestors,
it must be not by means of conclusions drawn from a scapula, an
axis, or even from a tooth, but by the discovery of forms so intermediate
in their general structure as to indicate an organisation
and, <i>ipso facto</i>, a mode of life, intermediate between the terrestrial
and the Cetacean form. There is no valid syllogism to the effect
that <i>A</i> has a flat curved scapula like a seal’s, and <i>B</i> has a flat,
curved scapula like a seal’s: and therefore <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are related
to the seals and to each other; it is merely a flagrant case of an
“undistributed middle.” But there is validity in an argument
that <i>B</i> shews in its general structure, extending over this bone
and that bone, resemblances both to <i>A</i> and to the seals: and that
therefore he may be presumed to be related to both, in his
hereditary habits of life and in actual kinship by blood. It is
cognate to this argument that (as every palaeontologist knows)
we find clues to affinity more easily, that is to say with less
confusion and perplexity, in certain structures than in others.
The deep-seated rhythms of growth which, as I venture to
think, are the chief basis of morphological heredity, bring about
similarities of form, which endure in the absence of conflicting
forces; but a new system of forces, introduced by altered environment
and habits, impinging on those particular parts of the fabric
which lie within this particular field of force, will assuredly not
be long of manifesting itself in notable and inevitable modifications
of form. And if this be really so, it will further imply that
modifications of form will tend to manifest themselves, not so
much in small and <i>isolated</i> phenomena, in this part of the fabric
or in that, in a scapula for instance or a humerus:
but rather in <span class="xxpn" id="p718">{718}</span>
some slow, <i>general</i>, and more or less uniform or graded modification,
spread over a number of correlated parts, and at times extending
over the whole, or over great portions, of the body. Whether
any such general tendency to widespread and correlated transformation
exists, we shall attempt to discuss in the following
chapter.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="p719">

<p>In the foregoing chapters of this book we have attempted to
study the inter-relations of growth and form, and the part which
certain of the physical forces play in this complex interaction;
and, as part of the same enquiry, we have tried in comparatively
simple cases to use math­e­mat­i­cal methods and math­e­mat­i­cal
terminology in order to describe and define the forms of organisms.
We have learned in so doing that our own study of organic form,
which we call by Goethe’s name of Morphology, is but a portion
of that wider Science of Form which deals with the forms assumed
by matter under all aspects and conditions, and, in a still wider
sense, with forms which are theoretically imaginable.</p>

<p>The study of form may be descriptive merely, or it may
become analytical. We begin by describing the shape of an object
in the simple words of common speech: we end by defining it
in the precise language of mathematics; and the one method
tends to follow the other in strict scientific order and historical
continuity. Thus, for instance, the form of the earth, of a raindrop
or a rainbow, the shape of the hanging chain, or the path of a stone
thrown up into the air, may all be described, however inadequately,
in common words; but when we have learned to comprehend
and to define the sphere, the catenary, or the parabola, we have
made a wonderful and perhaps a manifold advance. The math­e­mat­i­cal
definition of a “form” has a quality of precision which
was quite lacking in our earlier stage of mere description; it is
expressed in few words, or in still briefer
symbols, and these <span class="xxpn" id="p720">{720}</span>
words or symbols are so pregnant with meaning that thought
itself is economised; we are brought by means of it in touch with
Galileo’s aphorism (as old as Plato, as old as Pythagoras, as old
perhaps as the wisdom of the Egyptians), that “the Book of
Nature is written in characters of Geometry.”</p>

<p>Next, we soon reach through math­e­mat­i­cal analysis to math­e­mat­i­cal
synthesis; we discover homologies or identities which
were not obvious before, and which our descriptions obscured
rather than revealed: as for instance, when we learn that, however
we hold our chain, or however we fire our bullet, the contour
of the one or the path of the other is always math­e­mat­i­cally
homologous. Lastly, and this is the greatest gain of all, we pass
quickly and easily from the math­e­mat­i­cal conception of form in
its statical aspect to form in its dynamical relations: we pass from
the conception of form to an understanding of the forces which
gave rise to it; and in the representation of form and in the
comparison of kindred forms, we see in the one case a diagram
of forces in equi­lib­rium, and in the other case we discern the
magnitude and the direction of the forces which have sufficed to
convert the one form into the other. Here, since a change of
material form is only effected by the movement of matter, we have
once again the support of the schoolman’s and the philosopher’s
axiom, “<i>Ignorato motu, ignoratur Natura</i>.”</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>In the morphology of living things the use of math­e­mat­i­cal
methods and symbols has made slow progress; and there are
various reasons for this failure to employ a method whose
advantages are so obvious in the in­ves­ti­ga­tion of other physical
forms. To begin with, there would seem to be a psychological
reason lying in the fact that the student of living things is by
nature and training an observer of concrete objects and phenomena,
and the habit of mind which he possesses and cultivates is alien
to that of the theoretical mathematician. But this is by no
means the only reason; for in the kindred subject of mineralogy,
for instance, crystals were still treated in the days of Linnaeus
as wholly within the province of the naturalist, and were described
by him after the simple methods in use for animals and plants:
but as soon as Haüy showed the application
of mathematics to <span class="xxpn" id="p721">{721}</span>
the description and clas­si­fi­ca­tion of crystals, his methods were
immediately adopted and a new science came into being.</p>

<p>A large part of the neglect and suspicion of math­e­mat­i­cal
methods in organic morphology is due (as we have partly seen in
our opening chapter) to an ingrained and deep-seated belief that
even when we seem to discern a regular math­e­mat­i­cal figure in
an organism, the sphere, the hexagon, or the spiral which we so
recognise merely resembles, but is never entirely explained by,
its math­e­mat­i­cal analogue; in short, that the details in which the
figure differs from its math­e­mat­i­cal prototype are more important
and more interesting than the features in which it agrees, and
even that the peculiar aesthetic pleasure with which we regard
a living thing is somehow bound up with the departure from
math­e­mat­i­cal regularity which it manifests as a peculiar attribute
of life. This view seems to me to involve a misapprehension.
There is no such essential difference between these phenomena of
organic form and those which are manifested in portions of
inanimate matter<a class="afnanch" href="#fn642" id="fnanch642">642</a>.
No chain hangs in a perfect catenary and no
raindrop is a perfect sphere: and this for the simple reason that
forces and resistances other than the main one are inevitably at
work. The same is true of organic form, but it is for the mathematician
to unravel the conflicting forces which are at work
together. And this process of in­ves­ti­ga­tion may lead us on step
by step to new phenomena, as it has done in physics, where
sometimes a knowledge of form leads us to the interpretation of
forces, and at other times a knowledge of the forces at work
guides us towards a better insight into form. I would illustrate
this by the case of the earth itself. After the fundamental advance
had been made which taught us that the world was round, Newton
showed that the forces at work upon it must lead to its being
imperfectly spherical, and in the course of time its oblate spheroidal
shape was actually verified. But now, in turn, it has been shown
that its form is still more complicated, and the next step will be
to seek for the forces that have deformed the
oblate spheroid. <span class="xxpn" id="p722">{722}</span></p>

<p>The organic forms which we can define, more or less precisely,
in math­e­mat­i­cal terms, and afterwards proceed to explain and
to account for in terms of force, are of many kinds, as we have
seen; but nevertheless they are few in number compared with
Nature’s all but infinite variety. The reason for this is not far
to seek. The living organism represents, or occupies, a field of
force which is never simple, and which as a rule is of immense
complexity. And just as in the very simplest of actual cases we
meet with a departure from such symmetry as could only exist
under conditions of <i>ideal</i> simplicity, so do we pass quickly to
cases where the interference of numerous, though still perhaps very
simple, causes leads to a resultant which lies far beyond our powers
of analysis. Nor must we forget that the biologist is much more
exacting in his requirements, as regards form, than the physicist;
for the latter is usually content with either an ideal or a general
description of form, while the student of living things must needs
be specific. The physicist or mathematician can give us perfectly
satisfying expressions for the form of a wave, or even of a heap of
sand; but we never ask him to define the form of any particular
wave of the sea, nor the actual form of any mountain-peak or
hill<a class="afnanch" href="#fn643" id="fnanch643">643</a>.
<span class="xxpn" id="p723">{723}</span></p>

<p>For various reasons, then, there are a vast multitude of organic
forms which we are unable to account for, or to define, in math­e­mat­i­cal
terms; and this is not seldom the case even in forms which
are apparently of great simplicity and regularity. The curved
outline of a leaf, for instance, is such a case; its ovate, lanceolate,
or cordate shape is apparently very simple, but the difficulty of
finding for it a math­e­mat­i­cal expression is very great indeed.
To define the complicated outline of a fish, for instance, or of a
vertebrate skull, we never even seek for a math­e­mat­i­cal formula.</p>

<p>But in a very large part of morphology, our essential task lies
in the comparison of related forms rather than in the precise
definition of each; and the <i>deformation</i> of a complicated figure
may be a phenomenon easy of comprehension, though the figure
itself have to be left unanalysed and undefined. This process
of comparison, of recognising in one form a definite permutation
or <i>deformation</i> of another, apart altogether from a precise and
adequate understanding of the original “type” or standard of
comparison, lies within the immediate province of mathematics,
and finds its solution in the elementary use of a certain method
of the mathematician. This method is the Method of Co-ordinates,
on which is based the Theory of Transformations.</p>

<p>I imagine that when Descartes conceived the method of
co-ordinates, as a generalisation from the proportional diagrams
of the artist and the architect, and long before the immense
possibilities of this analysis could be foreseen, he had in mind a
very simple purpose; it was perhaps no more than to find a way
of translating the <i>form</i> of a curve into <i>numbers</i> and into <i>words</i>.
This is precisely what we do, by the method of co-ordinates,
every time we study a statistical curve; and conversely, we
translate numbers into form whenever we “plot a curve” to
illustrate a table of mortality, a rate of growth, or the daily
variation of temperature or barometric pressure. In precisely
the same way it is possible to inscribe in a net of rectangular
co-ordinates the outline, for instance, of a fish,
and so to translate <span class="xxpn" id="p724">{724}</span>
it into a table of numbers, from which again we may at pleasure
reconstruct the curve.</p>

<p>But it is the next step in the employment of co-ordinates
which is of special interest and use to the morphologist; and this
step consists in the alteration, or “transformation,” of our system
of co-ordinates and in the study of the cor­re­spon­ding transformation
of the curve or figure inscribed in the co-ordinate
network.</p>

<p>Let us inscribe in a system of Cartesian co-ordinates the outline
of an organism, however complicated, or a part thereof: such as
a fish, a crab, or a mammalian skull. We may now treat this
complicated figure, in general terms, as a function of <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>. If we
submit our rectangular system to “deformation,” on simple and
recognised lines, altering, for instance, the direction of the axes,
the ratio of <i>x&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;y</i>, or substituting
for <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> some more complicated
expressions, then we shall obtain a new system of co-ordinates,
whose deformation from the original type the inscribed figure
will precisely follow. In other words, we obtain a new figure,
which represents the old figure <i>under strain</i>, and is a function of
the new co-ordinates in precisely the same way as the old figure
was of the original co-ordinates <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>.</p>

<p>The problem is closely akin to that of the cartographer who
transfers identical data to one projection or another; and whose
object is to secure (if it be possible) a complete cor­re­spon­dence,
<i>in each small unit of area</i>, between the one representation and the
other. The morphologist will not seek to draw his organic forms
in a new and artificial projection; but, in the converse aspect of
the problem, he will inquire whether two different but more or
less obviously related forms can be so analysed and interpreted
that each may be shown to be a transformed representation of
the other. This once demonstrated, it will be a comparatively
easy task (in all probability) to postulate the direction and
magnitude of the force capable of effecting the required transformation.
Again, if such a simple alteration of the system of
forces can be proved adequate to meet the case, we may find
ourselves able to dispense with many widely current and more
complicated hypotheses of biological causation. For it is a
maxim in physics that an effect ought not to
be ascribed to <span class="xxpn" id="p725">{725}</span>
the joint operation of many causes if few are adequate to the
production of it: <i>Frustra fit per plura, quod fieri potest per
pauciora.</i></p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>It is evident that by the combined action of appropriate
forces any material form can be transformed into any other:
just as out of a “shapeless” mass of clay the potter or the sculptor
models his artistic product; or just as we attribute to Nature
herself the power to effect the gradual and successive transformation
of the simplest into the most complex organism. In
like manner it is possible, at least theoretically, to cause the outline
of any closed curve to appear as a projection of any other whatsoever.
But we need not let these theoretical con­si­de­ra­tions
deter us from our method of comparison of <i>related</i> forms. We
shall strictly limit ourselves to cases where the transformation
necessary to effect a comparison shall be of a simple kind, and
where the transformed, as well as the original, co-ordinates shall
constitute an harmonious and more or less symmetrical system.
We should fall into deserved and inevitable confusion if, whether
by the math­e­mat­i­cal or any other method, we attempted to
compare organisms separated far apart in Nature and in zoological
clas­si­fi­ca­tion. We are limited, not by the nature of our method,
but by the whole nature of the case, to the comparison of
organisms such as are manifestly related to one another and belong
to the same zoological class.</p>

<p>Our inquiry lies, in short, just within the limits which Aristotle
himself laid down when, in defining a “genus,” he showed that
(apart from those superficial characters, such as colour, which he
called “accidents”) the essential differences between one “species”
and another are merely differences of proportion, of relative
magnitude, or (as he phrased it) of “excess and defect.” “Save
only for a difference in the way of excess or defect, the parts are
identical in the case of such animals as are of one and the same
genus; and by ‘genus’ I mean, for instance, Bird or Fish.”
And again: “Within the limits of the same genus, as a general
rule, most of the parts exhibit differences&#x200a;...&#x200a;in the way of multitude
or fewness, magnitude or parvitude, in short, in the way of excess
or defect. For ‘the more’ and ‘the less’ may
be represented as <span class="xxpn" id="p726">{726}</span>
‘excess’ and ‘defect<a class="afnanch" href="#fn644" id="fnanch644">644</a>.’&#x200a;”
It is precisely this difference of relative
magnitudes, this Aristotelian “excess and defect” in the case of
form, which our co-ordinate method is especially adapted to
analyse, and to reveal and demonstrate as the main cause of what
(again in the Aristotelian sense) we term “specific” differences.</p>

<p>The applicability of our method to particular cases will depend
upon, or be further limited by, certain practical con­si­de­ra­tions
or qualifications. Of these the chief, and indeed the essential,
condition is, that the form of the entire structure under in­ves­ti­ga­tion
should be found to vary in a more or less uniform manner,
after the fashion of an ap­prox­i­mate­ly homogeneous and isotropic
body. But an imperfect isotropy, provided always that some
“principle of continuity” run through its variations, will not
seriously interfere with our method; it will only cause our transformed
co-ordinates to be somewhat less regular and harmonious
than are those, for instance, by which the physicist depicts the
motions of a perfect fluid or a theoretic field of force in a uniform
medium.</p>

<p>Again, it is essential that our structure vary in its entirety,
or at least that “independent variants” should be relatively few.
That independent variations occur, that localised centres of
diminished or exaggerated growth will now and then be found,
is not only probable but manifest; and they may even be so
pronounced as to appear to constitute new formations altogether.
Such independent variants as these Aristotle himself clearly
recognised: “It happens further that some have parts that others
have not; for instance, some [birds] have spurs and others not,
some have crests, or combs, and others not; but, as a general
rule, most parts and those that go to make up the bulk of the body
are either identical with one another, or differ from one another
in the way of contrast and of excess and defect. For ‘the more’
and ‘the less’ may be represented as ‘excess’ or ‘defect.’&#x200a;”</p>

<p>If, in the evolution of a fish, for instance, it be the case that
its several and constituent parts—head, body, and tail, or this
fin and that fin—represent so many independent variants, then
our co-ordinate system will at once become too complex to be
intelligible; we shall be making not one
comparison but several <span class="xxpn" id="p727">{727}</span>
separate comparisons, and our general method will be found
inapplicable. Now precisely this independent variability of parts
and organs—here, there, and everywhere within the organism—would
appear to be implicit in our ordinary accepted notions
regarding variation; and, unless I am greatly mistaken, it is
precisely on such a conception of the easy, frequent, and normal
independent variability of parts that our conception of the process
of natural selection is fundamentally based. For the morphologist,
when comparing one organism with another, describes the
differences between them point by point, and “character” by
“character<a class="afnanch" href="#fn645" id="fnanch645">645</a>.”
If he is from time to time constrained to admit
the existence of “correlation” between characters (as a hundred
years ago Cuvier first showed the way), yet all the while he
recognises this fact of correlation somewhat vaguely, as a phenomenon
due to causes which, except in rare instances, he can hardly
hope to trace; and he falls readily into the habit of thinking and
talking of evolution as though it had proceeded on the lines of his
own descriptions, point by point, and character by character<a class="afnanch" href="#fn646" id="fnanch646">646</a>.</p>

<p>But if, on the other hand, diverse and dissimilar fishes can be
referred as a whole to identical functions of very different co-ordinate
systems, this fact will of itself constitute a proof that
variation has proceeded on definite and orderly lines, that a
comprehensive “law of growth” has pervaded the whole structure
in its integrity, and that some more or less simple and recognisable
system of forces has been at work. It will not only show
how real and deep-seated is the phenomenon of “correlation,”
in regard to form, but it will also demonstrate the fact that
a correlation which had seemed too complex
for analysis or <span class="xxpn" id="p728">{728}</span>
comprehension is, in many cases, capable of very simple graphic
expression. This, after many trials, I believe to be in general
the case, bearing always in mind that the occurrence of independent
or localised variations must often be considered.</p>

<div class="psmprnt3">
<p>We are dealing in this chapter with the forms of related
organisms, in order to shew that the differences between
them are as a general rule simple and symmetrical, and just
such as might have been brought about by a slight and simple
change in the system of forces to which the living and
growing organism was exposed. Mathematically speaking, the
phenomenon is identical with one met with by the geologist,
when he finds a bed of fossils squeezed flat or otherwise
symmetrically deformed by the pressures to which they, and
the strata which contain them, have been subjected. In the
first step towards fossilisation, when the body of a fish
or shellfish is silted over and buried, we may take it that
the wet sand or mud exercises, ap­prox­i­mate­ly, a hydrostatic
pressure—that is to say a pressure which is uniform in all
directions, and by which the form of the buried object will
not be appreciably changed. As the strata consolidate and
accumulate, the fossil organisms which they contain will tend
to be flattened by the vast superincumbent load, just as
the stratum which contains them will also be compressed and
will have its molecular arrangement more or less modified&#xfeff;<a
class="afnanch" href="#fn647" id="fnanch647">647</a>. But the
deformation due to direct vertical pressure in a horizontal
stratum is not nearly so striking as are the deformations
produced by the oblique or shearing stresses to which inclined
and folded strata have been exposed, and by which their various
“dislocations” have been brought about. And especially in
mountain regions, where these dislocations are especially
numerous and complicated, the contained fossils are apt to be
so curiously and yet so symmetrically deformed (usually by a
simple shear) that they may easily be interpreted as so many
distinct and separate “species<a class="afnanch" href="#fn648"
id="fnanch648">648</a>.” A great number of described species,
and here and there a new genus (as the genus Ellipsolithes
for an obliquely deformed Goniatite or Nautilus) are said to
rest on no other foundation<a class="afnanch" href="#fn649"

<p>If we begin by drawing a net of rectangular equidistant

network in various ways, several of which are very simple
indeed. Thus (1) we may alter the dimensions of our system,
extending it along one or other axis, and so converting each

original net, and which we transfer
to the new, will thereby be <i>deformed</i> in strict proportion
to the deformation of the entire configuration, being still
defined by cor­re­spon­ding points in the network and being
throughout in conformity with the original figure. For
instance, a circle inscribed in the original “Cartesian”
net will now, after extension in the <i>y</i>-direction, be
found elongated <span class="xxpn" id="p730">{730}</span>
into an ellipse. In elementary math­e­mat­i­cal language,
for the original <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> we have substituted
<i>x</i>&#xfeff;<sub>1</sub> and <i>c&#xfeff;y</i>&#xfeff;<sub>1</sub>&#x202f;,
and the equation to our original circle,
<i>x</i>&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup>&#x202f;+&#x202f;<i>y</i>&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup>
=&#x202f;<i>a</i>&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup>&#x202f;, becomes that of the ellipse,
<i>x</i>&#xfeff;<sub>1</sub>&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup>&#x202f;+&#x202f;<i>c</i>&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup>&#x202f;<i>y</i>&#xfeff;<sub>1</sub>&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup>
=&#x202f;<i>a</i>&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup>&#x202f;.</p>

<p>If I draw the cannon-bone of an ox (Fig. <a href="#fig354" title="go to Fig. 354">354</a>, A), for instance,
within a system of rectangular co-ordinates, and then transfer
the same drawing, point for point, to a system in which for the
<i>x</i> of the original diagram we substitute <i>x&#xfeff;′</i>
=&#x202f;2<i>x</i>&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;3, we obtain a
drawing (B) which is a very close approximation to the cannon-bone
of the sheep. In other words, the main (and perhaps
the only) difference between the two bones is simply that that of
the sheep is elongated, along the vertical axis, as compared with
that of the ox in the relation of 3&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;2. And similarly, the long
slender cannon-bone of the giraffe (C) is referable to the same
identical type, subject to a reduction of breadth, or increase
of length, cor­re­spon­ding to <i>x&#xfeff;″</i>
=&#x202f;<i>x</i>&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;3.</p>

<p>(2) The second type is that where extension is not equal or
uniform at all distances from the origin: but grows greater
or less, as, for instance, when we stretch a <i>tapering</i>
elastic band. In such cases, as I have represented it in
Fig. <a href="#fig355" title="go to Fig. 355">355</a>, the ordinate increases logarithmically, and for
<i>y</i> we substitute ε&#xfeff;<sup class="spitc">y</sup>&#x202f;.
It is obvious that this logarithmic extension may involve
both abscissae and ordinates, <i>x</i> becoming ε&#xfeff;<sup
class="spitc">x</sup>&#x202f;, while <i>y</i> becomes ε&#xfeff;<sup
class="spitc">y</sup>&#x202f;. The circle in our original
figure is now deformed into some such shape as that of Fig.
<a href="#fig356" title="go to Fig. 356">356</a>. This method of deformation is a common one, and will often
be of use to us in our comparison of organic forms.</p>

<p>(3) Our third type is the “simple shear,” where the
rectangular co-ordinates become “oblique,” their axes
being inclined to one another at a certain angle ω. Our
original rectangle now becomes such a figure as that of
Fig. <a href="#fig357" title="go to Fig. 357">357</a>. The system may now be described in terms of the
oblique axes <i>X</i>, <i>Y</i>; or may be directly referred to new
rectangular co-ordinates ξ, η by the simple transposition
<i>x</i> =&#x202f;ξ&#x202f;−&#x202f;η&#x202f;cot&#x202f;ω, <i>y</i>
=&#x202f;η&#x202f;cosec&#x202f;ω.</p>

<p>(4) Yet another important class of deformations may be
represented by the use of radial co-ordinates, in which one set of
lines are represented as radiating from a point or “focus,” while
the other set are transformed into circular arcs cutting the radii
orthogonally. These radial co-ordinates
are especially applicable <span class="xxpn" id="p731">{731}</span>
to cases where there exists (either within or without the figure)
some part which is supposed to suffer no deformation; a simple
illustration is afforded by the diagrams which illustrate the
flexure of a beam (Fig. <a href="#fig358" title="go to Fig. 358">358</a>). In biology these co-ordinates will</p>

be especially applicable in cases where the growing structure
includes a “node,” or point where growth is absent or at a
minimum; and about which node the rate of growth may be
assumed to increase symmetrically. Precisely such a case is
furnished us in a leaf of an ordinary dicotyledon. The
leaf of a <span class="xxpn" id="p732">{732}</span>
typical monocotyledon—such as a grass or a hyacinth, for instance—grows
continuously from its base, and exhibits no node or “point
of arrest.” Its sides taper off gradually from its broad base to
its slender tip, according to some law of decrement specific to
the plant; and any alteration in the relative velocities of longitudinal
and transverse growth will merely make the leaf a little
broader or narrower, and will effect no other conspicuous alteration
in its contour. But if there once come into existence a node, or
“locus of no growth,” about which we may assume the growth—which
in the hyacinth leaf was longitudinal and transverse—to
take place radially and transversely to the radii, then we shall</p>

<p class="pcontinue">at once see, in the first place, that the sloping and slightly curved
sides of the hyacinth leaf suffer a transformation into what we
consider a more typical and “leaf-like” shape, the sides of the
figure broadening out to a zone of maximum breadth and then
drawing inwards to the pointed apex. If we now alter the ratio
between the radial and tangential velocities of growth—in other
words, if we increase the angles between cor­re­spon­ding radii—we
pass successively through the various con­fi­gur­a­tions which
the botanist describes as the lanceolate, the ovate, and finally
the cordate leaf. These successive changes may to some extent,
and in appropriate cases, be traced as the
individual leaf grows <span class="xxpn" id="p733">{733}</span>
to maturity; but as a much more general rule, the balance
of forces, the ratio between radial and tangential velocities of
growth, remains so nicely and constantly balanced that the leaf
increases in size without conspicuous modification of form. It is
rather what we may call a long-period variation, a tendency for
the relative velocities to alter from one generation to another,
whose result is brought into view by this method of illustration.</p>

<p>There are various corollaries to this method of describing the
form of a leaf which may be here alluded to, for we shall not return
again to the subject of radial co-ordinates. For instance, the
so-called unsymmetrical leaf<a class="afnanch" href="#fn650" id="fnanch650">650</a>
of a begonia, in which one side of
the leaf may be merely ovate while the other has a cordate outline,</p>

<p class="pcontinue">
is seen to be really a case of
<i>unequal</i>, and not truly asymmetrical,
growth on either side
of the midrib. There is nothing
more mysterious in its conformation
than, for instance, in that
of a forked twig in which one
limb of the fork has grown
longer than the other. The case
of the begonia leaf is of sufficient
interest to deserve illustration,
and in Fig. <a href="#fig360" title="go to Fig. 360">360</a> I have outlined
a leaf of the large <i>Begonia daedalea</i>.
On the smaller left-hand
side of the leaf I have taken at
random three points, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, and
have measured the angles, <i>AOa</i>,
etc., which the radii from the
hilus of the leaf to these points make with the median axis. On
the other side of the leaf I have marked the points <i>a&#xfeff;′</i>, <i>b&#xfeff;′</i>, <i>c&#xfeff;′</i>, such
that the radii drawn to this margin of the leaf are equal to the
former, <i>Oa&#xfeff;′</i> to <i>Oa</i>, etc. Now if the two sides
of the leaf are <span class="xxpn" id="p734">{734}</span>
math­e­mat­i­cally similar to one another, it is obvious that the
respective angles should be in continued proportion, i.e. as <i>AOa</i>
is to <i>AOa&#xfeff;′</i>, so should <i>AOb</i> be to <i>AOb&#xfeff;′</i>. This proves to be very
nearly the case. For I have measured the three angles on one
side, and one on the other, and have then compared, as follows,
the calculated with the observed values of the other two:

<p>The agreement is very close, and what discrepancy there is
may be amply accounted for, firstly, by the slight irregularity
of the sinuous margin of the leaf; and secondly, by the fact that
the true axis or midrib of the leaf is not straight but slightly
curved, and therefore that it is curvilinear and not rectilinear
triangles which we ought to have measured. When we understand
these few points regarding the peripheral curvature of the
leaf, it is easy to see that its principal veins ap­prox­i­mate closely
to a beautiful system of isogonal co-ordinates. It is also obvious
that we can easily pass, by a process of shearing, from those cases
where the principal veins start from the base of the leaf to those,
as in most dicotyledons, where they arise successively from the
midrib.</p>

<p>It may sometimes happen that the node, or “point of arrest,”
is at the upper instead of the lower end of the leaf-blade; and
occasionally there may be a node at both ends. In the former case,
as we have it in the daisy, the form of the leaf will be, as it were,
inverted, the broad, more or less heart-shaped, outline appearing
at the upper end, while below the leaf tapers gradually downwards
to an ill-defined base. In the latter case, as in <i>Dionaea</i>, we obtain
a leaf equally expanded, and similarly ovate or cordate, at both
ends. We may notice, lastly, that the shape of a solid fruit,
such as an apple or a cherry, is a solid of revolution, developed
from similar curves and to be explained on the same principle.
In the cherry we have a “point of arrest” at the base of the berry,
where it joins its peduncle, and about this point the fruit (in
imaginary section) swells out into a cordate outline;
while in the <span class="xxpn" id="p735">{735}</span>
apple we have two such well-marked points of arrest, above and
below, and about both of them the same conformation tends to
arise. The bean and the human kidney owe their “reniform”
shape to precisely the same phenomenon, namely, to the existence
of a node or “hilus,” about which the forces of growth are radially
and symmetrically arranged.</p>

<p>Most of the trans­for­ma­tions which we have hitherto considered
(other than that of the simple shear) are particular cases of a
general transformation, obtainable by the method of conjugate
functions and equivalent to the projection of the original figure
on a new plane. Appropriate trans­for­ma­tions, on these general
lines, provide for the cases of a coaxial system where the
Cartesian co-ordinates are replaced by coaxial circles, or a confocal
system in which they are replaced by confocal ellipses and
hyperbolas.</p>

<p>Yet another curious and important transformation, belonging
to the same class, is that by which a system of straight lines
becomes transformed into a conformal system of logarithmic
spirals: the straight line <i>Y</i>&#xfeff;−&#xfeff;<i>A&#xfeff;X</i>
=&#x202f;<i>c</i> cor­re­spon­ding to the
logarithmic spiral θ&#x202f;−&#x202f;<i>A</i>&#x202f;log&#x202f;<i>r</i>
=&#x202f;<i>c</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig361" title="go to Fig. 361">361</a>). This beautiful and</p>

<p class="pcontinue">
simple transformation lets us at once
convert, for instance, the straight
conical shell of the Pteropod or the
<i>Orthoceras</i> into the logarithmic spiral
of the Nautiloid; it involves a math­e­mat­i­cal
symbolism which is but a
slight extension of that which we
have employed in our elementary
treatment of the logarithmic spiral.</p>

<p>These various sys­tems of co-ordinates,
which we have now brief­ly
con­si­dered, are some­times called “iso­ther­mal
co-ordinates,” from the fact that, when em­ployed in
this particular branch of physics, they perfectly represent the
phenomena of the conduction of heat, the contour lines of equal
temperature appearing, under appropriate conditions, as the
orthogonal lines of the co-ordinate system. And
it follows that <span class="xxpn" id="p736">{736}</span>
the “law of growth” which our biological analysis by means of
orthogonal co-ordinate systems presupposes, or at least foreshadows,
is one according to which the organism grows or
develops along <i>stream lines</i>, which may be defined by a suitable
math­e­mat­i­cal transformation. <br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<p>When the system becomes no longer orthogonal, as in many
of the following illustrations—for instance, that of <i>Orthagoriscus</i>
(Fig. <a href="#fig382" title="go to Fig. 382">382</a>),—then the transformation is no longer within the reach
of comparatively simple math­e­mat­i­cal analysis. Such departure
from the typical symmetry of a “stream-line” system is, in the
first instance, sufficiently accounted for by the simple fact that
the developing organism is very far from being homogeneous and
isotropic, or, in other words, does not behave like a perfect fluid.
But though under such circumstances our co-ordinate systems
may be no longer capable of strict math­e­mat­i­cal analysis, they
will still indicate <i>graphically</i> the relation of the new co-ordinate
system to the old, and conversely will furnish us with some
guidance as to the “law of growth,” or play of forces, by which
the transformation has been effected.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Before we pass from this brief discussion of trans­for­ma­tions in
general, let us glance at one or two cases in which the forces applied
are more or less intelligible, but the resulting trans­for­ma­tions are,
from the math­e­mat­i­cal point of view, exceedingly complicated.</p>

<p>The “marbled papers” of the bookbinder are a beautiful
illustration of visible “stream lines.” On a dishful of a sort of
semi-liquid gum the workman dusts a few simple lines or patches
of colouring matter; and then, by passing a comb through the
liquid, he draws the colour-bands into the streaks, waves, and
spirals which constitute the marbled pattern, and which he then
transfers to sheets of paper laid down upon the gum. By some
such system of shears, by the effect of unequal traction or unequal
growth in various directions and superposed on an originally
simple pattern, we may account for the not dissimilar marbled
patterns which we recognise, for instance, on a large serpent’s
skin. But it must be remarked, in the case of the marbled paper,
that though the method of application of the forces is simple,
yet in the aggregate the system of forces set up
by the many <span class="xxpn" id="p737">{737}</span>
teeth of the comb is exceedingly complex, and its complexity is
revealed in the complicated “diagram of forces” which constitutes
the pattern.</p>

<p>To take another and still more instructive illustration. To
turn one circle (or sphere) into two circles would be, from the point
of view of the mathematician, an extraordinarily difficult transformation;
but, physically speaking, its achievement may be
extremely simple. The little round gourd grows naturally, by
its symmetrical forces of expansive growth, into a big, round, or
somewhat oval pumpkin or melon. But the Moorish husbandman
ties a rag round its middle, and the same forces of growth, unaltered
save for the presence of this trammel, now expand the globular
structure into two superposed and connected globes. And
again, by varying the position of the encircling band, or by
applying several such ligatures instead of one, a great variety of
artificial forms of “gourd” may be, and actually are, produced.
It is clear, I think, that we may account for many ordinary
biological processes of development or transformation of form by
the existence of trammels or lines of constraint, which limit and
determine the action of the expansive forces of growth that would
otherwise be uniform and symmetrical. This case has a close
parallel in the operations of the glassblower, to which we have
already, more than once, referred in passing<a class="afnanch" href="#fn651" id="fnanch651">651</a>.
The glassblower
starts his operations with a <i>tube</i>, which he first closes at one end
so as to form a hollow vesicle, within which his blast of air exercises
a uniform pressure on all sides; but the spherical conformation
which this uniform expansive force would naturally tend to
produce is modified into all kinds of forms by the trammels or
resistances set up as the workman lets one part or another of his
bubble be unequally heated or cooled. It was Oliver Wendell
Holmes who first shewed this curious parallel between the
operations of the glassblower and those of Nature, when she starts,
as she so often does, with a simple tube<a class="afnanch" href="#fn652" id="fnanch652">652</a>.
The alimentary canal, <span class="xxpn" id="p738">{738}</span>
the arterial system including the heart, the central nervous
system of the vertebrate, including the brain itself, all begin as
simple tubular structures. And with them Nature does just
what the glassblower does, and, we might even say, no more
than he. For she can expand the tube here and narrow it there;
thicken its walls or thin them; blow off a lateral offshoot or
caecal diverticulum; bend the tube, or twist and coil it; and
infold or crimp its walls as, so to speak, she pleases. Such a form
as that of the human stomach is easily explained when it is
regarded from this point of view; it is simply an ill-blown bubble,
a bubble that has been rendered lopsided by a trammel or restraint
along one side, such as to prevent its symmetrical expansion—such
a trammel as is produced if the glassblower lets one side of
his bubble get cold, and such as is actually present in the stomach
itself in the form of a muscular band.</p>

<p>We may now proceed to consider and illustrate a few permutations
or trans­for­ma­tions of organic form, out of the vast
multitude which are equally open to this method of inquiry.</p>

<div class="dleft dwth-e" id="fig362">

 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 362.</div></div>

<p>We have already compared in a preliminary fashion the
metacarpal or cannon-bone of the ox, the sheep, and the giraffe
(Fig. <a href="#fig354" title="go to Fig. 354">354</a>); and we have seen that the essential difference in form
between these three bones is a matter
of relative length and breadth, such
that, if we reduce the figures to an
identical standard of length (or identical
values of <i>y</i>), the breadth (or value of
<i>x</i>) will be ap­prox­i­mate­ly two-thirds
that of the ox in the case of the sheep
and one-third that of the ox in the
case of the giraffe. We may easily,
for the sake of closer comparison,
determine these ratios more accurately,
for instance, if it be our purpose to
compare the different racial varieties
within the limits of a single species.
And in such cases, by the way, as when we compare with one
another various breeds or races of cattle or of
horses, the ratios <span class="xxpn" id="p739">{739}</span>
of length and breadth in this particular bone are extremely
significant<a class="afnanch" href="#fn653" id="fnanch653">653</a>.
<br class="brclrfix" /></p>

<p>If, instead of limiting ourselves to the cannon-bone, we inscribe
the entire foot of our several Ungulates in a co-ordinate system,
the same ratios of <i>x</i> that served us for the cannon-bones still give
us a first approximation to the required comparison; but even
in the case of such closely allied forms as the ox and the sheep
there is evidently something wanting in the comparison. The
reason is that the relative elongation of the several parts, or
individual bones, has not proceeded equally or proportionately
in all cases; in other words, that the equations for <i>x</i> will not
suffice without some simultaneous modification of the values of
<i>y</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig362" title="go to Fig. 362">362</a>). In such a case it may be found possible to satisfy
the varying values of <i>y</i> by some logarithmic or other formula;
but, even if that be possible, it will probably be somewhat difficult
of discovery or verification in such a case as the present, owing
to the fact that we have too few well-marked points of cor­re­spon­dence
between the one object and the other, and that especially
along the shaft of such long bones as the cannon-bone of the ox,
the deer, the llama, or the giraffe there is a complete lack of easily
recognisable cor­re­spon­ding points. In such a case a brief tabular
statement of apparently cor­re­spon­ding values of <i>y</i>, or of those
obviously cor­re­spon­ding values which coincide with the boundaries
of the several bones of the foot, will, as in the following example,
enable us to dispense with a fresh equation.</p>

<p>That underlying the varying amounts of extension
to which the parts or segments of the limb have been
subject there is a law, or principle of continuity, may
be discerned from such a diagram as the above (Fig. <a href="#fig363" title="go to Fig. 363">363</a>),
where the values of <i>y</i> in the case of the ox are plotted
as a straight line, and the cor­re­spon­ding values for the

more or less regular and even curve. This simple graphic
result implies the existence of a comparatively simple

<p>An elementary application of the principle of

Albert Dürer in his <i>Geometry</i>, and especially in his <i>Treatise on

In this latter work, the
manner in which the <span class="xxpn" id="p741">{741}</span>

<p>In a tapir’s foot there is a striking difference, and yet at the
same time there is an obvious underlying resemblance, between
the middle toe and either of its unsymmetrical lateral neighbours.
Let us take the median terminal phalanx and inscribe its outline
in a net of rectangular equidistant co-ordinates (Fig. <a href="#fig365" title="go to Fig. 365">365</a>, <i>a</i>). Let
us then make a similar network about axes which are no longer
at right angles, but inclined to one another at an angle of about
50° (<i>b</i>). If into this new network we fill in, point for point,
an outline precisely cor­re­spon­ding to our original drawing of the
middle toe, we shall find that we have already represented the
main features of the adjacent lateral one. We shall, however,
perceive</p>

<p class="pcontinue"> that our new diagram looks a little
too bulky on one side, the inner side, of the lateral
toe. If now we substitute for our equidistant ordinates,
ordinates which get gradually closer and closer together
as we pass towards the median side of the toe, then we
shall obtain a diagram which differs in no essential
respect from an actual outline copy of the lateral toe
(<i>c</i>). In short, the difference between the outline
of the middle toe of the tapir and the next lateral
toe may be almost completely expressed by saying that
if the one be represented by rectangular equidistant
co-ordinates, the other will be represented by oblique
co-ordinates, whose axes make an angle of 50°, and in
which the abscissal interspaces decrease in a certain
logarithmic ratio. We treated our original complex curve
or projection of the tapir’s toe as a function of the
form <em class="embold"><i>F</i></em>&#xfeff;(<i>x</i>,&#x202f;<i>y</i>)

length of the ordinates. Side by side (Fig. <a href="#fig368" title="go to Fig. 368">368</a>) is drawn
a very different Copepod, of the genus <i>Sapphirina</i>; and about
it is drawn a network such that each co-ordinate passes (as nearly
as possible) through points cor­re­spon­ding to those of the former
figure. It will be seen that two differences are apparent. (1) The
values of <i>y</i> in Fig. <a href="#fig368" title="go to Fig. 368">368</a> are large in the upper part of the figure, and
diminish rapidly towards its base. (2) The values of <i>x</i> are very
large in the neighbourhood of the origin, but diminish rapidly as
we pass towards either side, away from the median vertical axis;
and it is probable that they do so according to a definite, but
somewhat complicated, ratio. If, instead of seeking for an
actual equation, we simply tabulate our values of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> in the
second figure as compared with the first (just as we did in comparing
the feet of the Ungulates), we get the dimensions of a net

<p>In this manner, with a single model or type to copy from, we
may record in very brief space the data requisite for the production
of ap­prox­i­mate outlines of a great number of forms. For instance
the difference, at first sight immense, between the attenuated
body of a <i>Caprella</i> and the thick-set body of a <i>Cyamus</i> is obviously
little, and is probably nothing, more than a difference of relative
magnitudes, capable of tabulation by numbers and of complete
expression by means of rectilinear co-ordinates.</p>

<p>The Crustacea afford innumerable instances of more complex
deformations. Thus we may compare various higher Crustacea
with one another, even in the case of such dissimilar forms as a
lobster and a crab. It is obvious that the whole body of the
former is elongated as compared with the latter, and that the
crab is relatively broad in the region of the carapace, while it
tapers off rapidly towards its attenuated and abbreviated tail.
In a general way, the elongated rectangular
system of co-ordinates <span class="xxpn" id="p744">{744}</span>
in which we may inscribe the outline of the lobster becomes a
shortened triangle in the case of the crab. In a little more detail
we may compare the outline of the carapace in various crabs one
with another: and the comparison will be found easy and significant,
even, in many cases, down to minute details, such as the
number and situation of the marginal spines, though these are in
other cases subject to independent variability.</p>

 <i>Paralomis</i>; 5, <i>Lupa</i>; 6, <i>Chorinus</i>.</div></div>

<p>If we choose, to begin with, such a crab as <i>Geryon</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig369" title="go to Fig. 369">369</a>, 1),
and inscribe it in our equidistant rectangular co-ordinates, we shall
see that we pass easily to forms more elongated
in a transverse <span class="xxpn" id="p745">{745}</span>
direction, such as <i>Matuta</i> or <i>Lupa</i> (5), and conversely, by
transverse compression, to such a form as <i>Corystes</i> (2). In
certain other cases the carapace conforms to a triangular diagram,
more or less curvilinear, as in Fig. <a href="#fig4" title="go to Fig. 4">4</a>, which represents
the genus <i>Paralomis</i>. Here we can easily see that the posterior
border is transversely elongated as compared with that of <i>Geryon</i>,
while at the same time the anterior part is longitudinally extended
as compared with the posterior. A system of slightly curved and
converging ordinates, with orthogonal and logarithmically interspaced
abscissal lines, as shown in the figure, appears to satisfy
the conditions.</p>

<p>In an interesting series of cases, such as the genus <i>Chorinus</i>,
or <i>Scyramathia</i>, and in the spider-crabs generally, we appear to
have just the converse of this. While the carapace of these crabs
presents a somewhat triangular form, which seems at first sight
more or less similar to those just described, we soon see that the
actual posterior border is now narrow instead of broad, the
broadest part of the carapace cor­re­spon­ding precisely, not to
that which is broadest in <i>Paralomis</i>, but to that which was broadest
in <i>Geryon</i>; while the most striking difference from the latter lies
in an antero-posterior lengthening of the forepart of the carapace,
culminating in a great elongation of the frontal region, with its
two spines or “horns.” The curved ordinates here converge
posteriorly and diverge widely in front (Figs. <a href="#fig3" title="go to Fig. 3">3</a> and 6), while
the decremental interspacing of the abscissae is very marked
indeed.</p>

<p>We put our method to a severer test when we attempt to sketch
an entire and complicated animal than when we simply compare
cor­re­spon­ding parts such as the carapaces of various Malacostraca,
or related bones as in the case of the tapir’s toes. Nevertheless,
up to a certain point, the method stands the test very well. In
other words, one particular mode and direction of variation is
often (or even usually) so prominent and so paramount throughout
the entire organism, that one comprehensive system of co-ordinates
suffices to give a fair picture of the actual phenomenon. To take
another illustration from the Crustacea, I have drawn roughly in
Fig. <a href="#fig370" title="go to Fig. 370">370</a>, 1 a little amphipod of the family Phoxocephalidae
(<i>Harpinia</i> sp.). Deforming the co-ordinates of the
figure into the <span class="xxpn" id="p746">{746}</span>
curved orthogonal system in Fig. <a href="#fig2" title="go to Fig. 2">2</a>, we at once obtain a very fair
representation of an allied genus, belonging to a different family
of amphipods, namely <i>Stegocephalus</i>. As we proceed further from

<p>The hydroid zoophytes constitute a “polymorphic” group,
within which a vast number of species have already been distinguished;
and the labours of the systematic naturalist are
constantly adding to the number. The specific distinctions are
for the most part based, not upon
characters directly presented <span class="xxpn" id="p747">{747}</span>
by the living animal, but upon the form, size and arrangement
of the little cups, or “calycles,” secreted and inhabited by the
little individual polypes which compose the compound organism.
The variations, which are apparently infinite, of these conformations
are easily seen to be a question of relative magnitudes, and
are capable of complete expression, sometimes by very simple,
sometimes by somewhat more complex, co-ordinate networks.</p>

<p>For instance, the varying shapes of the simple wineglass-shaped
cups of the Campanularidae are at once sufficiently
represented and compared by means of simple Cartesian co-ordinates
(Fig. <a href="#fig371" title="go to Fig. 371">371</a>). In the two allied families of Plumulariidae and
Aglaopheniidae the calycles are set unilaterally upon a jointed
stem, and small cup-like structures (holding rudimentary polypes)
are associated with the large calycles in definite number and
position. These small calyculi are variable in number, but in the
great majority of cases they accompany the large calycle in
groups of three—two standing by its upper border, and one,
which is especially variable in form and magnitude, lying at its
base. The stem is liable to flexure and, in a high degree, to
extension or compression; and these variations extend, often on
an exaggerated scale, to the related calycles. As a result we find
that we can draw various systems of curved or sinuous co-ordinates,
which express, all but completely, the configuration
of the various <span class="xxpn" id="p748">{748}</span>
hydroids which we inscribe therein (Fig. <a href="#fig372" title="go to Fig. 372">372</a>). The comparative
smoothness or denticulation of the margin of the calycle, and the
number of its denticles, constitutes an independent variation, and</p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig375" title="go to Fig. 375">375</a> is an outline diagram of a typical Scaroid fish. Let us
deform its rectilinear co-ordinates into a system of (ap­prox­i­mate­ly)
coaxial circles, as in Fig. <a href="#fig376" title="go to Fig. 376">376</a>, and then filling into the new system,
space by space and point by point, our former diagram of <i>Scarus</i>,
we obtain a very good outline of an allied fish, belonging to a
neighbouring family, of the genus <i>Pomacanthus</i>. This case is all
the more interesting, because upon the body of our <i>Pomacanthus</i>
there are striking colour bands, which correspond in direction
very closely to the lines of our new curved ordinates. In like
manner, the still more bizarre outlines of other fishes of the same
family of Chaetodonts will be found to correspond to very slight
modifications of similar co-ordinates; in other words, to small
variations in the values of the constants of the coaxial curves.</p>

<p>In Figs. <a href="#fig377" title="go to Fig. 377">377</a>–380 I have rep­re­sent­ed another series of Acan­thop­ter­ygian

we start this series with the figure of <i>Polyprion</i>, in Fig. <a href="#fig377" title="go to Fig. 377">377</a>, we see
that the outlines of <i>Pseudo­pria­can­thus</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig378" title="go to Fig. 378">378</a>) and of <i>Sebastes</i> or
<i>Scorpaena</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig379" title="go to Fig. 379">379</a>) are easily derived by substituting a system
of triangular, or radial, co-ordinates for the
rectangular ones in <span class="xxpn" id="p750">{750}</span>
which we had inscribed <i>Poly­prion</i>. The very curious fish <i>Antigonia

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig381" title="go to Fig. 381">381</a> is a common, typical <i>Diodon</i> or porcupine-fish, and in
Fig. <a href="#fig382" title="go to Fig. 382">382</a> I have deformed its vertical co-ordinates into a system

<p class="pcontinue">
nevertheless, it is symmetrical to the eye, and obviously approaches
to an isogonal system under certain conditions of friction or
constraint. And as such it accounts, by one single integral
transformation, for all the apparently separate and distinct
external differences between the two fishes. It leaves the parts
near to the origin of the system, the whole region of the head,
the opercular orifice and the pectoral
fin, practically unchanged <span class="xxpn" id="p752">{752}</span>
in form, size and position; and it shews a greater and greater
apparent modification of size and form as we pass from the origin
towards the periphery of the system.</p>

<p>In a word, it is sufficient to account for the new and striking
contour in all its essential details, of rounded body, exaggerated
dorsal and ventral fins, and truncated tail. In like manner, and
using precisely the same co-ordinate networks, it appears to me
possible to shew the relations, almost bone for bone, of the skeletons
of the two fishes; in other words, to reconstruct the skeleton of
the one from our knowledge of the skeleton of the other, under
the guidance of the same cor­re­spon­dence as is indicated in their
external configuration.</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>The family of the crocodiles has had a special interest for the
evolutionist ever since Huxley pointed out that, in a degree only
second to the horse and its ancestors, it furnishes us with a close
and almost unbroken series of transitional forms, running down
in continuous succession from one geological formation to another.
I should be inclined to transpose this general statement into other
terms, and to say that the Crocodilia constitute a case in which,
with unusually little complication from the presence of independent
variants, the trend of one particular mode of transformation is
visibly manifested. If we exclude meanwhile from our comparison
a few of the oldest of the crocodiles, such as <i>Belodon</i>, which differ
more fundamentally from the rest, we shall find a long series of
genera in which we can refer not only the changing contours of
the skull, but even the shape and size of the many constituent
bones and their intervening spaces or “vacuities,” to one and the
same simple system of transformed co-ordinates. The manner
in which the skulls of various Crocodilians differ from one another
may be sufficiently illustrated by three or four examples.</p>

 <div class="dcaption">Fig. 383. A, <i>Crocodilus porosus</i>.

<p>Let us take one of the typical modern crocodiles as our standard
of form, e.g. <i>C. porosus</i>, and inscribe it, as in Fig. <a href="#fig383" title="go to Fig. 383">383</a>, <i>a</i>, in the
usual Cartesian co-ordinates. By deforming the rectangular network
into a triangular system, with the apex of the triangle a
little way in front of the snout, as in <i>b</i>, we pass to such a form as
<i>C. americanus</i>. By an exaggeration of the same process we at
once get an approximation to the form of one
of the sharp-snouted, <span class="xxpn" id="p753">{753}</span>
or longirostrine, crocodiles, such as the genus <i>Tomistoma</i>; and,
in the species figured, the oblique position of the orbits, the arched
contour of the occipital border, and certain other characters suggest
a certain amount of curvature, such as I have represented in the
diagram (Fig. <a href="#fig383" title="go to Fig. 383">383</a>, <i>b</i>), on the part of the horizontal co-ordinates.
In the still more elongated skull of such a form as the Indian
Gavial, the whole skull has undergone a great longitudinal
extension, or, in other words, the ratio of <i>x&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;y</i> is greatly diminished;
and this extension is not uniform, but is at a maximum in the
region of the nasal and maxillary bones. This especially elongated
region is at the same time narrowed in an exceptional degree, and
its excessive narrowing is represented by a curvature, convex
towards the median axis, on the part of the vertical ordinates.
Let us take as a last illustration one of the Mesozoic crocodiles,
the little <i>Notosuchus</i>, from the Cretaceous formation. This little
crocodile is very different from our type in the proportions of its
skull. The region of the snout, in front of and including the frontal
bones, is greatly shortened; from constituting fully two-thirds of
the whole length of the skull in <i>Crocodilus</i>, it now constitutes less
than half, or, say, three-sevenths of the whole; and the whole
skull, and especially its posterior part, is curiously compact,
broad, and squat. The orbit is unusually large. If in the diagram
of this skull we select a number of
points obviously cor­re­spon­ding <span class="xxpn" id="p754">{754}</span>
to points where our rectangular co-ordinates intersect particular
bones or other recognisable features in our typical crocodile, we
shall easily discover that the lines joining these points in <i>Notosuchus</i>
fall into such a co-ordinate network as that which is
represented in Fig. <a href="#fig383" title="go to Fig. 383">383</a>, <i>c</i>. To all intents and purposes, then, this
not very complex system, representing one harmonious “deformation,”
accounts for <i>all</i> the differences between the two figures,
and is sufficient to enable one at any time to reconstruct a detailed
drawing, bone for bone, of the skull of <i>Notosuchus</i> from the model
furnished by the common crocodile.</p>

<p>The many diverse forms of Dinosaurian reptiles, all of which
manifest a strong family likeness underlying much superficial
diversity, furnish us with plentiful material for comparison by
the method of trans­for­ma­tions. As an instance, I have figured
the pelvic bones of <i>Stegosaurus</i> and of <i>Camptosaurus</i> (Fig. <a href="#fig384" title="go to Fig. 384">384</a>,
<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) to show that, when the former is taken as our Cartesian
type, a slight curvature and an ap­prox­i­mate­ly logarithmic
extension of the <i>x</i>-axis brings us easily to the configuration of
the other. In the original specimen of <i>Camptosaurus</i> described
by Marsh<a class="afnanch" href="#fn658" id="fnanch658">658</a>,
the anterior portion of the iliac bone is missing; and
in Marsh’s restoration this part of the bone is drawn as though
it came somewhat abruptly to a sharp point.
In my figure I <span class="xxpn" id="p755">{755}</span>
have completed this missing part of the bone in harmony with the
general co-ordinate network which is suggested by our comparison
of the two entire pelves; and I venture to think that the result
is more natural in appearance, and more likely to be correct than
was Marsh’s conjectural restoration. It would seem, in fact,
that there is an obvious field for the employment of the method
of co-ordinates in this task of reproducing missing portions of a
structure to the proper scale and in harmony with related types.
To this subject we shall presently return.</p>

occipital bone is drawn out into an enormous backwardly-directed

backwards; the orbit is small; and the</p>

quadrate bone is strongly
inclined downwards and forwards. The whole skull has a configuration
which stands, apparently, in the strongest possible
contrast to that of a more normal Ornithosaurian such as

(Fig. <a href="#fig387" title="go to Fig. 387">387</a>, <i>a</i>), and refer our <i>Pteranodon</i> to a system of
oblique co-ordinates (<i>b</i>), in which the two co-ordinate systems of
parallel lines become each a pencil of diverging rays, we make
manifest a cor­re­spon­dence which extends uniformly throughout
all parts of these very different-looking skulls.</p>

I have said, <span class="xxpn" id="p757">{757}</span>
that it may also be employed for drawing hypothetical structures,
on the assumption that they have varied from a known form in
some definite way. And this process may be especially useful,

forms which are actually known to exist, in other words, of reconstructing

figured by Osborn in his Monograph of the Extinct Rhinoceroses<a class="afnanch" href="#fn659" id="fnanch659">659</a>
(Fig. <a href="#fig394" title="go to Fig. 394">394</a>).</p>

<p>The many other forms of primitive rhinoceros described in
the monograph differ from <i>Hyrachyus</i> in various details—in the
characters of the teeth, sometimes in the number of the toes, and
so forth; and they also differ very considerably
in the general <span class="xxpn" id="p761">{761}</span>
appearance of the skull. But these differences in the conformation
of the skull, conspicuous as they are at first sight, will be found
easy to bring under the conception of a simple and homogeneous
transformation, such as would result from the application of some
not very complicated stress. For instance, the cor­re­spon­ding</p>

<p class="pcontinue">
co-ordinates of <i>Aceratherium tridactylum</i>, as shown in Fig. <a href="#fig395" title="go to Fig. 395">395</a>,
indicate that the essential difference between this skull and the
former one may be summed up by saying that the long axis of the
skull of <i>Aceratherium</i> has undergone a slight double curvature,
while the upper parts of the skull have at the
same time been <span class="xxpn" id="p762">{762}</span>
subject to a vertical expansion, or to growth in somewhat greater
proportion than the lower parts. Precisely the same changes,
on a somewhat greater scale, give us the skull of an existing
rhinoceros.</p>

<p>Among the species of <i>Aceratherium</i>, the posterior, or occipital,
view of the skull presents specific differences which are perhaps
more conspicuous than those furnished by the side view; and
these differences are very strikingly brought out by the series of
conformal trans­for­ma­tions</p>

<p class="pcontinue">
which I have represented in Fig. <a href="#fig396" title="go to Fig. 396">396</a>.
In this case it will perhaps be noticed that the cor­re­spon­dence
is not always quite accurate in small details. It could easily
have been made much more accurate by giving a slightly sinuous
curvature to certain of the co-ordinates. But as they stand,
the cor­re­spon­dence indicated is very close, and the simplicity of
the figures illustrates all the better the general character of the
transformation.</p>

<p>By similar and not more violent changes we pass easily to such
allied forms as the Titanotheres (Fig. <a href="#fig397" title="go to Fig. 397">397</a>); and the well-known
series of species of <i>Titanotherium</i>, by which
Professor Osborn has <span class="xxpn" id="p763">{763}</span>
illustrated the evolution of this genus, constitutes a simple and
suitable case for the application of our method.</p>

<p>But our method enables us to pass over greater gaps than these,
and to discern the general, and to a very large extent even the
detailed, resemblances between the skull of the rhinoceros and
those of the tapir or the horse. From the Cartesian co-ordinates
in which we have begun by inscribing the skull of a primitive
rhinoceros, we pass to the tapir’s skull (Fig. <a href="#fig398" title="go to Fig. 398">398</a>), firstly, by converting
the rectangular into a triangular network, by which we
represent the depression of the anterior and the progressively
increasing elevation of the posterior part of the skull; and
secondly, by giving to the vertical ordinates a curvature such as
to bring about a certain longitudinal compression, or condensation,
in the forepart of the skull, especially in the nasal and orbital
regions.</p>

<p>The conformation of the horse’s skull departs from that of our
primitive Perissodactyle (that is to say our early type of rhinoceros,
<i>Hyrachyus</i>) in a direction that is nearly the opposite of that taken
by <i>Titanotherium</i> and by the recent species of rhinoceros. For
we perceive, by Fig. <a href="#fig399" title="go to Fig. 399">399</a>, that the horizontal co-ordinates, which
in these latter cases became transformed into curves with the
concavity upwards, are curved, in the case of the horse, in the
opposite direction. And the vertical ordinates, which are also
curved, somewhat in the same fashion as in the tapir, are very
nearly equidistant, instead of being, as in that animal, crowded
together anteriorly. Ordinates and abscissae
form an oblique <span class="xxpn" id="p764">{764}</span>
system, as is shown in the figure. In this case I have attempted
to produce the network beyond the region which is actually
required to include the diagram of the horse’s skull, in order to
show better the form of the general transformation, with a part
only of which we have actually to deal.</p>

<p>It is at first sight not a little surprising to find that we can pass,
by a cognate and even simpler transformation, from our Perissodactyle
skulls to that of the rabbit; but the fact that we can
easily do so is a simple illustration of the undoubted affinity
which exists between the Rodentia, especially the family of the
Leporidae, and the more primitive Ungulates. For my part, I
would go further; for I think there is strong reason to believe
that the Perissodactyles are more closely related to the Leporidae
than the former are to the other Ungulates, or than the Leporidae
are to the rest of the Rodentia. Be that as it may, it is obvious
from Fig. <a href="#fig400" title="go to Fig. 400">400</a> that the rabbit’s skull conforms to
a system of <span class="xxpn" id="p765">{765}</span>
co-ordinates cor­re­spon­ding to the Cartesian co-ordinates in which
we have inscribed the skull of <i>Hyrachyus</i>, with the difference,
firstly, that the horizontal ordinates of the latter are transformed
into equidistant curved lines, ap­prox­i­mate­ly arcs of circles, with
their concavity directed downwards; and secondly, that the
vertical ordinates are transformed into a pencil of rays ap­prox­i­mate­ly
orthogonal to the circular arcs. In short, the configuration
of the rabbit’s skull is derived from that of our primitive rhinoceros
by the unexpectedly simple process of submitting the latter to a</p>

individual bones does not conform quite so well to the general
transformation as it does when we are comparing the several
Perissodactyles one with another; and the chief departures
from conformity will be found in the size of the orbit and in the
outline of the immediately surrounding bones. The simple fact
is that the relatively enormous eye of the rabbit constitutes an
independent variation, which cannot be brought into the general
and fundamental transformation, but must</p>

<hr class="hrblk" />

<p>Before we leave the Perissodactyla and their allies, let us look
a little more closely into the case of the horse and its immediate
relations or ancestors, doing so with the help of a set of diagrams
which I again owe to Mr Gerard Heilmann<a class="afnanch" href="#fn660" id="fnanch660">660</a>.
Here we start afresh,
with the skull (Fig. <a href="#fig402" title="go to Fig. 402">402</a>, <i>A</i>) of <i>Hyracotherium</i> (or <i>Eohippus</i>),
inscribed in a simple Cartesian network. At the other end of the
series (<i>H</i>) is a skull of Equus, in its own cor­re­spon­ding network;
and the intermediate stages (<i>B</i>–<i>G</i>) are all drawn by direct and
simple interpolation, as in Mr Heilmann’s former series of drawings
of <i>Archaeopteryx</i> and <i>Apatornis</i>. In this present case, the relative
magnitudes are shewn, as well as the forms, of the several skulls.
Alongside of these reconstructed diagrams, are set figures of
certain extinct “horses” (Equidae or Palaeotheriidae), and in
two cases, viz. <i>Mesohippus</i> and <i>Protohippus</i> (<i>M</i>, <i>P</i>), it will be
seen that the actual fossil skull coincides in the most perfect
fashion with one of the hypothetical forms or stages which our
method shews to be implicitly involved in the transition from
<i>Hyracotherium</i> to <i>Equus</i>. In a third case, that of <i>Parahippus</i>
(<i>Pa</i>), the cor­re­spon­dence (as Mr Heilmann points out) is by no
means exact. The outline of this skull comes nearest to that of
the hypothetical transition stage <i>D</i>, but the “fit” is now a bad
one; for the skull of <i>Parahippus</i> is evidently a longer, straighter
and narrower skull, and differs in other minor characters besides.
In short, though some writers have placed <i>Parahippus</i> in the
direct line of descent between <i>Equus</i> and <i>Eohippus</i>, we see at
once that there is no place for it there, and that it must, accordingly,
represent a somewhat divergent branch or offshoot of the
Equidae<a class="afnanch" href="#fn661" id="fnanch661">661</a>.
It may be noticed, especially in the
case of <i>Protohippus</i> <span class="xxpn" id="p769">{769}</span>
(<i>P</i>), that the configuration of the angle of the jaw does not tally
quite so accurately with that of our hypothetical diagrams as do
other parts of the skull. As a matter of fact, this region is
somewhat variable, in different species of a genus, and even in
different individuals of the same species; in the small figure (<i>Pp</i>)
of <i>Protohippus placidus</i> the cor­re­spon­dence is more exact.</p>

<p>In considering this series of figures we cannot but be
struck, not only with the regularity of the succession
of “trans­for­ma­tions,” but also with the slight and
inconsiderable differences which separate the known
and recorded stages, and even the two extremes of the
whole series. These differences are no greater (save in
regard to actual magnitude) than those between one human
skull and another, at least if we take into account the
older or remoter races; and they are again no greater,
but if anything less, than the range of variation,
racial and individual, in certain other human bones, for
instance the scapula<a class="afnanch" href="#fn662"
id="fnanch662">662</a>.</p>

 Dwight). <i>A</i>, Caucasian; <i>B</i>, Negro; <i>C</i>, North American
 Indian (from Kentucky Mountains).</div></div>

<p>The variability of this latter bone is great,
but it is neither <span class="xxpn" id="p770">{770}</span>
surprising nor peculiar; for it is linked with all the con­si­de­ra­tions
of mechanical efficiency and functional modification which we
dealt with in our last chapter. The scapula occupies, as it were,
a focus in a very important field of force; and the lines of force
converging on it will be very greatly modified by the varying
development of the muscles over a large area of the body and of
the uses to which they are habitually put.</p>

<p>Let us now inscribe in our Cartesian co-ordinates the outline
of a human skull (Fig. <a href="#fig404" title="go to Fig. 404">404</a>), for the purpose of comparing it with
the skulls of some of the higher apes. We know beforehand that
the main differences between the human and the simian types
depend upon the enlargement or expansion of the brain and
braincase in man, and the relative diminution or enfeeblement of
his jaws. Together with these changes, the “facial angle”
increases from an oblique angle to nearly a right
angle in man, <span class="xxpn" id="p771">{771}</span>
and the configuration of every constituent bone of the face and
skull undergoes an alteration. We do not know to begin with,
and we are not shewn by the ordinary methods of comparison,
how far these various changes form part of one harmonious and
congruent transformation, or whether we are to look, for instance,
upon the changes undergone by the frontal, the occipital, the
maxillary, and the mandibular regions as a congeries of separate
modifications or independent variants. But as soon as we have
marked out a number of points in the gorilla’s or chimpanzee’s
skull, cor­re­spon­ding with those which our co-ordinate network
intersected in the human skull, we find that these cor­re­spon­ding
points may be at once linked up by smoothly curved lines of
intersection, which form a new system of co-ordinates and constitute
a simple “projection” of our human skull. The network</p>

represented in Fig. <a href="#fig405" title="go to Fig. 405">405</a> constitutes such a projection of the human
skull on what we may call, figuratively speaking, the “plane” of
the chimpanzee; and the full diagram in Fig. <a href="#fig406" title="go to Fig. 406">406</a> demonstrates
the cor­re­spon­dence. In Fig. <a href="#fig407" title="go to Fig. 407">407</a> I have shewn the similar deformation
in the case of a baboon, and it is obvious that the
transformation is of precisely the same order, and differs only in
an increased intensity or degree of deformation.</p>

<p>In both dimensions, as we pass from above downwards and
from behind forwards, the cor­re­spon­ding areas of the network
are seen to increase in a gradual and ap­prox­i­mate­ly logarithmic
order in the lower as compared with the higher type of skull;
and, in short, it becomes at once manifest that the modifications
of jaws, braincase, and the regions between are all portions of one
continuous and integral process. It is of course easy
to draw the <span class="xxpn" id="p772">{772}</span>
inverse diagrams, by which the Cartesian co-ordinates of the ape
are transformed into curvilinear and non-equidistant co-ordinates
in man.</p>

<p>From this comparison of the gorilla’s or chimpanzee’s with
the human skull we realise that an inherent weakness underlies
the anthropologist’s method of comparing skulls by reference to
a small number of axes. The most important of these are the
“facial” and “basicranial” axes, which include between them the
“facial angle.” But it is, in the first place, evident that these
axes are merely the principal axes of a system of co-ordinates,
and that their restricted and isolated use neglects all that can be
learned from the filling in of the rest of the co-ordinate network.
And, in the second place, the “facial axis,” for instance, as
ordinarily used in the anthropological comparison of one human
skull with another, or of the human skull with the gorilla’s, is
in all cases treated as a straight line; but our in­ves­ti­ga­tion has
shewn that rectilinear axes only meet the case in the simplest
and most closely related trans­for­ma­tions; and that, for instance,
in the anthropoid skull no rectilinear axis is homologous with a
rectilinear axis in a man’s skull, but what is a straight line in the
one has become a certain definite curve in the other.</p>

<p>Mr Heilmann tells me that he has tried, but without success,
to obtain a transitional series between the human skull and some
prehuman, anthropoid type, which series (as in the case of the
Equidae) should be found to contain other known types in direct
linear sequence. It appears impossible, however, to obtain such a
series, or to pass by successive and continuous gradations through
such forms as Mesopithecus, Pithecanthropus, <i>Homo neanderthalensis</i>,
and the lower or higher races of modern man. The
failure is not the fault of our method. It merely indicates that
no one straight line of descent, or of consecutive transformation,
exists; but on the contrary, that among human and anthropoid
types, recent and extinct, we have to do with a complex problem
of divergent, rather than of continuous, variation. And in like
manner, easy as it is to correlate the baboon’s and chimpanzee’s
skulls severally with that of man, and easy as it is to see that the
chimpanzee’s skull is much nearer to the human type than is the
baboon’s, it is also not difficult to perceive that the
series is not, <span class="xxpn" id="p773">{773}</span>
strictly speaking, continuous, and that neither of our two apes
lies <i>precisely</i> on the same direct line or sequence of deformation
by which we may hypothetically connect the other with
man.</p>

<p>As a final illustration I have drawn the outline of a dog’s
skull (Fig. <a href="#fig408" title="go to Fig. 408">408</a>), and inscribed it in a network comparable with
the Cartesian network of the human skull in Fig. <a href="#fig404" title="go to Fig. 404">404</a>. Here we
attempt to bridge over a wider gulf than we have crossed in any
of our former comparisons. But, nevertheless, it is obvious that
our method still holds good, in spite of the fact that there are
various specific differences, such as the open or closed orbit, etc.,
which have to be separately described and accounted for. We
see that the chief essential differences in plan between the dog’s
skull and the man’s lie in the fact that, relatively speaking, the</p>

<p class="pcontinue">former tapers away in front, a
triangular taking the place of a rectangular conformation;
secondly, that, coincident with the tapering off, there
is a progressive elongation, or pulling out, of the whole
forepart of the skull; and lastly, as a minor difference,
that the straight vertical ordinates of the human skull
become curved, with their convexity directed forwards, in
the dog. While the net result is that in the dog, just as
in the chimpanzee, the brain-pan is smaller and the jaws
are larger than in man, it is now conspicuously evident
that the co-ordinate network of the ape is by no means
intermediate between those which fit the other two. The
mode of deformation is on different lines; and, while it
may be correct to say that the chimpanzee and the baboon
are more brute-like, it would be by no means accurate
to assert that they are more dog-like, than man. <span
class="xxpn" id="p774">{774}</span></p>

<p>In this brief account of co-ordinate trans­for­ma­tions and of
their morphological utility I have dealt with plane co-ordinates
only, and have made no mention of the less elementary subject
of co-ordinates in three-dimensional space. In theory there is
no difficulty whatsoever in such an extension of our method; it
is just as easy to refer the form of our fish or of our skull to the
rectangular co-ordinates <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>z</i>, or to the polar co-ordinates
ξ, η, ζ, as it is to refer their plane projections to the two axes to
which our in­ves­ti­ga­tion has been confined. And that it would
be advantageous to do so goes without saying; for it is the shape
of the solid object, not that of the mere drawing of the object,
that we want to understand; and already we have found some
of our easy problems in solid geometry leading us (as in the case
of the form of the bivalve and even of the univalve shell) quickly
in the direction of co-ordinate analysis and the theory of conformal
trans­for­ma­tions. But this extended theme I have not attempted
to pursue, and it must be left to other times, and to other hands.
Nevertheless, let us glance for a moment at the sort of simple
cases, the simplest possible cases, with which such an in­ves­ti­ga­tion
might begin; and we have found our plane co-ordinate systems
so easily and effectively applicable to certain fishes that we may
seek among them for our first and tentative introduction to the
three-dimensional field.</p>

<p>It is obvious enough that the same method of description and
analysis which we have applied to one plane, we may apply to
another: drawing by observation, and by a process of trial and
error, our various cross-sections and the co-ordinate systems
which seem best to correspond. But the new and important
problem which now emerges is to <i>correlate</i> the deformation or
transformation which we discover in one plane with that which
we have observed in another: and at length, perhaps, after
grasping the general principles of such correlation, to forecast
ap­prox­i­mate­ly what is likely to take place in the other two planes
of reference when we are acquainted with one, that is to say, to
determine the values along one axis in terms of the other two.</p>

<p>Let us imagine a common “round” fish, and a common “flat”
fish, such as a haddock and a plaice. These two fishes are not as
nicely adapted for comparison by means of
plane co-ordinates as <span class="xxpn" id="p775">{775}</span>
some which we have studied, owing to the presence of essentially
unimportant, but yet conspicuous differences in the position of
the eyes, or in the number of the fins,—that is to say in the manner
in which the continuous dorsal fin of the plaice appears in the
haddock to be cut or scolloped into a number of separate fins.
But speaking broadly, and apart from such minor differences as
these, it is manifest that the chief factor in the case (so far as we
at present see) is simply the broadening out of the plaice’s body,
as compared with the haddock’s, in the dorso-ventral direction,
that is to say, along the <i>y</i> axis; in other words, the ratio <i>x&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;y</i>
is much less, (and indeed little more than half as great), in the
haddock than in the plaice. But we also recognise at once that
while the plaice (as compared with the haddock) is expanded in
one direction, it is also flattened, or thinned out, in the other:
<i>y</i> increases, but <i>z</i> diminishes, relatively to <i>x</i>. And furthermore,
we soon see that this is a common or even a general phenomenon.
The high, expanded body in our Antigonia or in our sun-fish is
at the same time flattened or <i>compressed</i> from side to side, in
comparison with the related fishes which we have chosen as
standards of reference or comparison; and conversely, such a
fish as the skate, while it is expanded from side to side in comparison
with a shark or dogfish, is at the same time flattened or
<i>depressed</i> in its vertical section. We proceed then, to enquire
whether there be any simple relation of <i>magnitude</i> discernible
between these twin factors of expansion and compression; and
the very fact that the two dimensions tend to vary <i>inversely</i>
already assures us that, in the general process of deformation, the
<i>volume</i> is less affected than are the <i>linear dimensions</i>. Some years
ago, when I was studying the length-weight co-efficient in fishes
(of which we have already spoken in Chap. III, p. <a href="#p098" title="go to pg. 98">98</a>), that is to
say the coefficient <i>k</i> in the formula <i>W</i>
=&#x202f;<i>k&#xfeff;L</i>&#xfeff;<sup>3</sup>&#x202f;, or <i>k</i>
=&#x202f;<i>W&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;L</i>&#xfeff;<sup>3</sup>&#x202f;, I
was not a little surprised to find that <i>k</i> was all but identical in
two such different looking fishes as our haddock and our plaice:
thus indicating that these two fishes, little as they resemble one
another externally (though they belong to two closely related
families), have ap­prox­i­mate­ly the same <i>volume</i> when they are
equal in <i>length</i>; or, in other words, that the extent to which the
plaice’s body has become expanded or broadened
is <i>just about <span class="xxpn" id="p776">{776}</span>
compensated for</i> by the extent to which it has also got flattened
or thinned. In short, if we could permit ourselves to conceive
of a haddock being directly transformed into a plaice, a very
large part of the change would be simply accounted for by supposing
the former fish to be “rolled out,” as a baker rolls a piece of dough.
This is, as it were, an extreme case of the <i>balancement des organes</i>,
or “compensation of parts.”</p>

<p>Simple Cartesian co-ordinates will not suffice very well to
compare the haddock with the plaice, for the deformation undergone
by the former in comparison with the latter is more on the
lines of that by which we have compared our Antigonia with our
Polyprion; that is to say, the expansion is greater towards the
middle of the fish’s length, and dwindles away towards either
end. But again simplifying our illustration to the utmost, and
being content with a rough comparison, we may assert that,
when haddock and plaice are brought to the same standard of
length, we can inscribe them both (ap­prox­i­mate­ly) in rectangular
co-ordinate networks, such that <i>Y</i> in the plaice is about twice
as great as <i>y</i> in the haddock. But if the volumes of the two
fishes be equal, this is as much as to say that <i>xyz</i> in the one case
(or rather the summation of all these values) is equal to <i>XYZ</i>
in the other; and therefore (since <i>X</i>
=&#x202f;<i>x</i>, and <i>Y</i>
=&#x202f;2<i>y</i>), it follows
that <i>Z</i>
=&#x202f;<i>z</i>&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;2. When we have drawn our vertical transverse
section of the haddock (or projected that fish in the <i>yz</i> plane), we
have reason accordingly to anticipate that we can draw a similar
projection (or section) of the plaice by simply doubling the <i>y</i>’s
and halving the <i>z</i>’s: and, very ap­prox­i­mate­ly, this turns out to
be the case. The plaice is (in round numbers) just about twice
as broad and also just about half as thick as the haddock; and
therefore the ratio of breadth to thickness (or <i>y</i> to <i>z</i>) is just about
four times as great in the one case as in the other.</p>

<p>It is true that this simple, or simplified, illustration carries us
but a very little way, and only half prepares us for much greater
complications. For instance, we have no right or reason to presume
that the equality of weights, or volumes, is a common,
much less a general rule. And again, in all cases of more complex
deformation, such as that by which we have compared Diodon
with the sunfish, we must be prepared for
very much more <span class="xxpn" id="p777">{777}</span>
recondite methods of comparison and analysis, leading doubtless to
very much more complicated results. In this last case, of Diodon
and the sunfish, we have seen that the vertical <i>expansion</i> of the
latter as compared with the former fish, increases rapidly as we
go backwards towards the tail; but we can by no means say that
the lateral <i>compression</i> increases in like proportion. If anything,
it would seem that the said expansion and compression tend to
vary inversely; for the Diodon is very thick in front and greatly
thinned away behind, while the flattened sunfish is more nearly
of the same thickness all the way along. Interesting as the whole
subject is we must meanwhile leave it alone; recognising, however,
that if the difficulties of description and representation could be
overcome, it is by means of such co-ordinates in space that we
should at last obtain an adequate and satisfying picture of the
processes of deformation and of the directions of growth<a class="afnanch" href="#fn663" id="fnanch663">663</a>.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="p778">
<h2 class="h2herein" title="Epilogue.">EPILOGUE.</h2></div>

<p>In the beginning of this book I said that its scope and treatment
were of so prefatory a kind that of other preface it had no
need; and now, for the same reason, with no formal and elaborate
conclusion do I bring it to a close. The fact that I set little store
by certain postulates (often deemed to be fundamental) of our
present-day biology the reader will have discovered and I have
not endeavoured to conceal. But it is not for the sake of polemical
argument that I have written, and the doctrines which I do not
subscribe to I have only spoken of by the way. My task is finished
if I have been able to shew that a certain math­e­mat­i­cal aspect of
morphology, to which as yet the morphologist gives little heed, is
interwoven with his problems, complementary to his descriptive
task, and helpful, nay essential, to his proper study and comprehension
of Form. <i>Hic artem remumque repono.</i></p>

<p>And while I have sought to shew the naturalist how a few
math­e­mat­i­cal concepts and dynamical principles may help and
guide him, I have tried to shew the mathematician a field for his
labour,—a field which few have entered and no man has explored.
Here may be found homely problems, such as often tax the
highest skill of the mathematician, and reward his ingenuity all
the more for their trivial associations and outward semblance of
simplicity.</p>

<p>That I am no skilled mathematician I have had little need to
confess, but something of the use and beauty of mathematics I
think I am able to understand. I know that in the study of
material things, number, order and position are the threefold clue
to exact knowledge; that these three, in the mathematician’s
hands, furnish the “first outlines for a sketch of the Universe”;
that by square and circle we are helped, like Emile Verhaeren’s
carpenter, to conceive “Les lois indubitables et fécondes Qui sont
la règle et la clarté du monde.”</p>

<p>For the harmony of the world is made manifest in Form and
Number, and the heart and soul and all the
poetry of Natural <span class="xxpn" id="p779">{779}</span>
Philosophy are embodied in the concept of math­e­mat­i­cal beauty.
A greater than Verhaeren had this in mind when he told of “the
golden compasses, prepared In God’s eternal store.” A greater
than Milton had magnified the theme and glorified Him “who
sitteth upon the circle of the earth,” saying: He measureth the
waters in the hollow of his hand, he meteth out the heavens with
his span, he comprehendeth the dust of the earth in a measure.</p>

<p>Moreover the perfection of math­e­mat­i­cal beauty is such (as
Maclaurin learned of the bee), that whatsoever is most beautiful
and regular is also found to be most useful and excellent.</p>

<p>The living and the dead, things animate and inanimate, we
dwellers in the world and this world wherein we
dwell,—πάντα γα μὰν τὰ γιγνωσκόμενα,—are
bound alike by physical and
math­e­mat­i­cal law. “Conterminous with space and coeval with
time is the kingdom of Mathematics; within this range her
dominion is supreme; otherwise than according to her order
nothing can exist, and nothing takes place in contradiction to her
laws.” So said, some forty years ago, a certain mathematician;
and Philolaus the Pythagorean had said much the same.</p>

<p>But with no less love and insight has the science of Form and
Number been appraised in our own day and generation by a very
great Naturalist indeed:—by that old man eloquent, that wise
student and pupil of the ant and the bee, who died but yesterday,
and who in his all but saecular life tasted of the firstfruits of
immortality; who curiously conjoined the wisdom of antiquity
with the learning of to-day; whose Provençal verse seems set to
Dorian music; in whose plainest words is a sound as of bees’
industrious murmur; and who, being of the same blood and
marrow with Plato and Pythagoras, saw in Number “la clef de la
voûte,” and found in it “le comment et le
pourquoi des choses.”</p>

I am inclined to trace back Driesch’s teaching of
Entelechy to no less a person than Melanchthon. When Bacon (<i>de

been regarded rather as a function than as a substance,” R. L. Ellis
points out that he is referring to Melanchthon’s exposition of the
Aristotelian doctrine. For Melanchthon, whose view of the peripatetic
philosophy had long great influence in the Protestant Universities,
affirmed that, according to the true view of Aristotle’s opinion, the
soul is not a substance, but an ἑντελέχεια, or <i>function</i>. He
defined it as δύναμις <i>quaedam ciens actiones</i>—a description
all but identical with that of Claude Bernard’s “<i>force vitale</i>.”</p></div>

This general principle was clearly grasped by Dr George
Rainey (a learned physician of St Bartholomew’s) many years ago, and
expressed in such words as the following: “......it is illogical to
suppose that in the case of vital organisms a distinct force exists
to produce results perfectly within the reach of physical agencies,
especially as in many instances no end could be attained were that the
case, but that of opposing one force by another capable of effecting
exactly the same purpose.” (On Artificial Calculi, <i>Q.J.M.S.</i> (<i>Trans.

In a famous lecture (Conservation of Forces
applied to Organic Nature, <i>Proc. Roy. Instit.</i>, April
12, 1861), Helmholtz laid it down, as “the fundamental
principle of physiology,” that “There may be other agents
acting in the living body than those agents which act in
the inorganic world; but those forces, as far as they cause
chemical and mechanical influence in the body, must be
<i>quite of the same character</i> as inorganic forces: in this
at least, that their effects must be ruled by necessity,
and must always be the same when acting in the same
conditions; and so there cannot exist any arbitrary choice
in the direction of their actions.” It would follow from
this, that, like the other “physical” forces, they must be
subject to math­e­mat­i­cal analysis and deduction. Cf. also

It would seem to be a common if not a general
rule that marine organisms, zoophytes, molluscs, etc., tend
to be larger than the cor­re­spon­ding and closely related
forms living in fresh water. While the phenomenon may have
various causes, it has been attributed (among others)
to the simple fact that the forces of growth are less
antagonised by gravity in the denser medium (cf. Houssay,
<i>La Forme et la Vie</i>, 1900, p. 815). The effect of
gravity on outward <i>form</i> is illustrated, for instance, by
the contrast between the uniformly upward branching of a

<i>Introduction to Entomology</i>, 1826,
<span class="smmaj">II,</span> p. 190. K. and S., like many less learned
authors, are fond of popular illustrations of the “wonders
of Nature,” to the neglect of dynamical principles. They
suggest, for instance, that if the white ant were as big as
a man, its tunnels would be “magnificent cylinders of more
than three hundred feet in diameter”; and that if a
certain noisy Brazilian insect were as big as a man, its
voice would be heard all the world over: “so that Stentor
becomes a mute when compared with these insects!” It is an
easy consequence of anthropomorphism, and hence a common
char­ac­ter­is­tic of fairy-tales, to neglect the principle of
dynamical, while dwelling on the aspect of geometrical,
similarity.</p></div>

There is probably also another factor involved

bring its centre of gravity nearer to the pivot, that is to

of surface-energy, Wolfgang Ostwald has introduced the
conception of <i>specific surface</i>, that is to say the ratio
of surface to volume, or <i>S&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;V</i>. In a cube, <i>V</i>
=&#x202f;<i>l</i>&#xfeff;<sup>3</sup>&#x202f;,
and <i>S</i>
=&#x202f;6<i>l</i>&#xfeff;<sup>2</sup>&#x202f;; therefore <i>S&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;V</i>
=&#x202f;6&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>l</i>. Therefore if
the side <i>l</i> measure 6
cm., the ratio <i>S&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;V</i>
=&#x202f;1, and such a cube may be taken
as our standard, or unit of specific surface. A human
blood-corpuscle has, accordingly, a specific surface of
somewhere about 14,000 or 15,000. It is found in physical
chemistry that surface energy becomes an important factor
when the specific surface reaches a value of 10,000 or
thereby.</p></div>

Thus the fibres of the crystalline lens are of

of the Blood-corpuscles in Rana, <i>Biometrika</i>, <span class="smmaj">VI,</span>
p. 403, 1909. Dr Thomas Young caught sight of the
phenomenon, early in last century: “The solid particles of
the blood do not by any means vary in magnitude in the same
ratio with the bulk of the animal,” <i>Natural Philosophy</i>,
ed. 1845, p. 466; and Leeuwenhoek and Stephen Hales were
aware of it a hundred years before. But in this case,
though the blood-corpuscles show no relation of magnitude
to the size of the animal, they do seem to have some
relation to its activity. At least the corpuscles in the
sluggish Amphibia are much the largest known to us, while
the smallest are found among the deer and other agile and
speedy mammals. (Cf. Gulliver, <i>P.Z.S.</i> 1875, p. 474, etc.)
This apparent correlation may have its bearing on modern
views of the surface-condensation or adsorption of oxygen
in the blood-corpuscles, a process which would be greatly
facilitated and intensified by the increase of surface due
to their minuteness.</p></div>

While the difference in cell-volume is vastly
less than that between the volumes, and very much less
also than that between the surfaces, of the respective
animals, yet there <i>is</i> a certain difference; and this it
has been attempted to correlate with the need for each
cell in the many-celled ganglion of the larger animal to
possess a more complex “exchange-system” of branches, for
intercommunication with its more numerous neighbours.
Another explanation is based on the fact that, while
such cells as continue to divide throughout life tend to
uniformity of size in all mammals, those which do not do
so, and in particular the ganglion cells, continue to
grow, and their size becomes, therefore, a function of the
duration of life. Cf. G. Levi, Studii sulla grandezza delle

layers; another thought that, by such con­si­de­ra­tions, we
‘put the cart before the horse’: and one more recent author
states, that we have better things to do in embryology
than to discuss tensions of germinal layers and similar
questions, since all explanations must of necessity be of
a phylogenetic nature. This opposition to the application
of the fundamental principles of science to embryological
questions would scarcely be intelligible had it not a
dogmatic background. No other explanation of living forms
is allowed than heredity, and any which is founded on
another basis must be rejected&#x200a;.......&#x200a;To think that heredity

The continuity of the phenomenon of growth,
and the natural passage from the phase of increase to that
of decrease or decay, are admirably discussed by Enriques,
in “La morte,” <i>Riv. di Scienza</i>, 1907, and in “Wachsthum
und seine analytische Darstellung,” <i>Biol. Centralbl.</i>
June, 1909. Haller (<i>Elem</i>. <span class="smmaj">VII,</span> p. 68) recognised

No such point of inflection appears in
the curve of weight according to C. M. Jackson’s data
(On the Prenatal Growth of the Human Body, etc., <i>Amer.
Journ. of Anat.</i> <span class="smmaj">IX,</span> 1009, pp. 126, 156), nor
in those quoted by him from Ahlfeld, Fehling and others.
But it is plain that the very rapid increase of the
monthly weights, ap­prox­i­mate­ly in the ratio of the cubes
of the cor­re­spon­ding lengths, would tend to conceal any
such breach of continuity, unless it happened to be very
marked indeed. Moreover in the case of Jackson’s data (and
probably also in the others) the actual age of the embryos
was not determined, but was estimated from their lengths.
The following is Jackson’s estimate of average weights at
intervals of a lunar month:</p>

I do not say that the assumption that these
two groups of earwigs were of different ages is altogether
an easy one; for of course, even in an insect whose
metamorphosis is so simple as the earwig’s, consisting only
in the acquisition of wings or wing-cases, we usually take
it for granted that growth proceeds no more after the final
stage, or “adult form” is attained, and further that this
adult form is attained at an ap­prox­i­mate­ly constant age,
and constant magnitude. But even if we are not permitted
to think that the earwig may have grown, or moulted,
after once the elytra were produced, it seems to me far
from impossible, and far from unlikely, that prior to the
appearance of the elytra one more stage of growth, or one
more moult took place in some cases than in others: for the
number of moults is known to be variable in many species of
Orthoptera. Unfortunately Bateson tells us nothing about
the sizes or total lengths of his earwigs; but his figures
suggest that it was bigger earwigs that had the longer
tails; and that the rate of growth of the tails had had
a certain definite ratio to that of the bodies, but not
necessarily a simple ratio of equality.</p></div>

by the Growth of Trees, <i>Bull. Amer. Geograph. Soc.</i>
<span class="smmaj">XLVI,</span> pp. 321–335, 1914. Mr Douglass does not fail
to notice the long period here described; but he lays more
stress on the occurrence of shorter cycles (of 11, 21 and
33 years), well known to meteorologists. Mr Douglass is
inclined (and I think rightly) to correlate the variations
in growth directly with fluctuations in rainfall, that is
to say with alternate periods of moisture and aridity; but
he points out that the temperature curves (and also the
sunspot curves) are markedly similar.</p></div>

On growth in relation to light, see Davenport,
<i>Exp. Morphology</i>, <span class="smmaj">II,</span> ch. xvii. In some cases (as
in the roots of Peas), exposure to light seems to have no
effect on growth; in other cases, as in diatoms (according
to Whipple’s experiments, quoted by Davenport, <span class="smmaj">II,</span>
p. 423), the effect of light on growth or multiplication
is well-marked, measurable, and apparently capable of
expression by a logarithmic formula. The discrepancy would
seem to arise from the fact that, while light-energy always
tends to be absorbed by the chlorophyll of the plant,
converted into chemical energy, and stored in the shape
of starch or other reserve materials, the actual rate of
growth depends on the rate at which these reserves are
drawn on: and this is another matter, in which light-energy
is no longer directly concerned.</p></div>

Lucret. v, 877. “Lucretius nowhere seems to
recognise the possibility of improvement or change of
species by ‘natural selection’; the animals remain as they
were at the first, except that the weaker and more useless

Even after we have so narrowed the scope
and sphere of natural selection, it is still hard to
understand; for the causes of <i>extinction</i> are often
wellnigh as hard to comprehend as are those of the <i>origin</i>
of species. If we assert (as has been lightly done) that
Smilodon perished owing to its gigantic tusks, that
Teleosaurus was handicapped by its exaggerated snout,
or Stegosaurus weighed down by its intolerable load of
armour, we may be reminded of other kindred forms to
show that similar conditions did not necessarily lead to
extermination, or that rapid extinction ensued apart from
any such visible or apparent disadvantages. Cf. Lucas, F.

While it has been very common to look upon
the phenomena of mitosis as sufficiently explained by
the results <i>towards which</i> they seem to lead, we may
find here and there a strong protest against this mode of
interpretation. The following is a case in point: “On a
tenté d’établir dans la mitose dite primitive plusieurs
catégories, plusieurs types de mitose. On a choisi le plus
souvent comme base de ces systèmes des concepts abstraits
et téléologiques: répartition plus ou moins exacte de
la chromatine entre les deux noyaux-fils suivant qu’il
y a ou non des chromosomes (<i>Dangeard</i>), distribution
particulière et signification dualiste des substances
nucléaires (substance kinétique et substance générative ou
héréditaire, <i>Hartmann et ses élèves</i>), etc. Pour moi tous
ces essais sont à rejeter catégoriquement à cause de leur
caractère finaliste; de plus, ils sont construits sur des
concepts non démontrés, et qui parfois représentent des
généralisations absolument erronées.” A. Alexeieff, <i>Archiv
für Protistenkunde</i>, <span class="smmaj">XIX,</span> p. 344, 1913.</p></div>

The con­fi­gur­a­tions, as obtained by the
usual experimental methods, were of course known long
before Faraday’s day, and constituted the “convergent
and divergent magnetic curves” of eighteenth century
mathematicians. As Leslie said, in 1821, they were
“regarded with wonder by a certain class of dreaming
philosophers, who did not hesitate to consider them as
the actual traces of an invisible fluid, perpetually
circulating between the poles of the magnet.” Faraday’s
great advance was to interpret them as indications of
<i>stress in a medium</i>,—of tension or attraction along
the lines, and of repulsion transverse to the lines, of the
diagram.</p></div>

The appearance of “vacuolation” is a result
of endosmosis or the diffusion of a less dense fluid
into the denser plasma of the cell. <i>Caeteris paribus</i>,
it is less apparent in marine organisms than in those of
freshwater, and in many or most marine Ciliates and even
Rhizopods a contractile vacuole has not been observed
(Bütschli, in Bronn’s <i>Protozoa</i>, p. 1414); it is also
absent, and probably for the same reason, in parasitic
Protozoa, such as the Gregarines and the Entamoebae.
Rossbach shewed that the contractile vacuole of ordinary
freshwater Ciliates was very greatly diminished in a 5 per
cent. solution of NaCl, and all but disappeared in a 1
per cent. solution of sugar (<i>Arb. z. z. Inst. Würzburg</i>,
1872, cf. Massart, <i>Arch. de Biol.</i> <span class="smmaj">LX,</span> p. 515,
1889). <i>Actinophrys sol</i>, when gradually acclimatised to
sea-water, loses its vacuoles, and <i>vice versa</i> (Gruber,
<i>Biol. Centralbl.</i> <span class="smmaj">IX,</span> p. 22, 1889); and the
same is true of Amoeba (Zuelzer, <i>Arch. f. Entw. Mech.</i>
1910, p. 632). The gradual enlargement of the contractile
vacuole is precisely analogous to the change of size of
a bubble until the gases on either side of the film are
equally diffused, as described long ago by Draper (<i>Phil.
Mag.</i> (n. s.), <span class="smmaj">XI,</span> p. 559, 1837). Rhumbler has
shewn that contractile or pulsating vacuoles may be well
imitated in chloroform-drops, suspended in water in
which various substances are dissolved (<i>Arch. f. Entw.
Mech.</i> <span class="smmaj">VII,</span> 1898, p. 103). The pressure within
the contractile vacuole, always greater than without,
diminishes with its size, being inversely proportional
to its radius; and when it lies near the surface of the
cell, as in a Heliozoon, it bursts as soon as it reaches
a thinness which its viscosity or molecular cohesion no
longer permits it to maintain.</p></div>

Whence the name “mitosis” (Greek μίτος,
a thread), applied first by Flemming to the whole
phenomenon. Kollmann (<i>Biol. Centralbl.</i> <span class="smmaj">II,</span>
p. 107, 1882) called it <i>divisio per fila</i>, or <i>divisio
laqueis implicata</i>. Many of the earlier students, such as
Van Beneden (Rech. sur la maturation de l’œuf, <i>Arch. de
Biol.</i> <span class="smmaj">IV,</span> 1883), and Hermann (Zur Lehre v. d.
Entstehung d. karyokinetischen Spindel, <i>Arch. f. mikrosk.
Anat.</i> <span class="smmaj">XXXVII,</span> 1891) thought they recognised
actual muscular threads, drawing the nuclear material
asunder towards the respective foci or poles; and some
such view was long maintained by other writers, Boveri,
Heidenhain, Flemming, R. Hertwig, and many more. In fact,
the existence of contractile threads, or the ascription
to the spindle rather than to the poles or centrosomes of
the active forces concerned in nuclear division, formed
the main tenet of all those who declined to go beyond the
“contractile properties of protoplasm” for an explanation
of the phenomenon. (Cf. also J. W. Jenkinson, <i>Q. J. M. S.</i>

are very closely applicable to the ordinary microscopic appearance of the protoplasm

un peu de colloide dans beaucoup d’eau&#x200a;...&#x200a;Evidemment cette structure se forme

If the word <i>permeability</i> be deemed too
directly suggestive of the phenomena of <i>magnetism</i> we may
replace it by the more general term of <i>specific inductive
capacity</i>. This would cover the particular case, which is
by no means an improbable one, of our phenomena being due
to a “surface charge” borne by the nucleus itself and also
by the chromosomes: this surface charge being in turn the
result of a difference in inductive capacity between the
body or particle and its surrounding medium. (Cf. footnote,

In like manner Hardy has shewn that colloid
particles migrate with the negative stream if the reaction
of the surrounding fluid be alkaline, and <i>vice versa</i>.
The whole subject is much wider than these brief allusions
suggest, and is essentially part of Quincke’s theory of
Electrical Diffusion or Endosmosis: according to which the
particles and the fluid in which they float (or the fluid
and the capillary walls through which it flows) each carry
a charge, there being a discontinuity of potential at the
surface of contact, and hence a field of force leading to
powerful tangential or shearing stresses, communicating
to the particles a velocity which varies with the density
per unit area of the surface charge. See W. B. Hardy’s
paper on Coagulation by Electricity, <i>Journ. of Physiol.</i>

The idea of a “surface-tension” in liquids
was first enunciated by Segner, <i>De figuris superficierum
fluidarum</i>, in <i>Comment. Soc. Roy. Göttingen</i>, 1751,
p. 301. Hooke, in the <i>Micrographia</i> (1665, Obs.
<span class="smmaj">VIII,</span> etc.), had called attention to the globular
or spherical form of the little morsels of steel struck
off by a flint, and had shewn how to make a powder of such
spherical grains, by heating fine filings to melting point.
“This Phaenomenon” he said “proceeds from a propriety which
belongs to all kinds of fluid Bodies more or less, and
is caused by the Incongruity of the Ambient and included
Fluid, which so acts and modulates each other, that
they acquire, as neer as is possible, a <i>spherical</i> or
<i>globular</i> form....”</p></div>

Haycraft and Carlier pointed out (<i>Proc.
R.S.E.</i> <span class="smmaj">XV,</span> pp. 220–224, 1888) that the amoeboid
movements of a white blood-corpuscle are only manifested
when the corpuscle is in contact with some solid substance:
while floating freely in the plasma or serum of the
blood, these corpuscles are spherical, that is to say
they are at rest and in equi­lib­rium. The same fact has
recently been recorded anew by Ledingham (On Phagocytosis
from an adsorptive point of view, <i>Journ. of Hygiene</i>,
<span class="smmaj">XII,</span> p. 324, 1912). On the emission of pseudopodia
as brought about by changes in surface tension, see also
(<i>int. al.</i>) Jensen, Ueber den Geotropismus niederer
Organismen, <i>Pflüger’s Archiv</i>, <span class="smmaj">LIII,</span> 1893. Jensen
remarks that in Orbitolites, the pseudopodia issuing
through the pores of the shell first float freely, then
as they grow longer bend over till they touch the ground,
whereupon they begin to display amoeboid and streaming
motions. Verworn indicates (<i>Allg. Physiol.</i> 1895, p. 429),
and Davenport says (<i>Experim. Morphology</i>, <span class="smmaj">II,</span> p.
376) that “this persistent clinging to the substratum is
a ‘thigmotropic’ reaction, and one which belongs clearly
to the category of ‘response.’&#x200a;” (Cf. Pütter, Thigmotaxis
bei Protisten, <i>A. f. Physiol.</i> 1900, Suppl. p. 247.) But
it is not clear to my mind that to account for this simple
phenomenon we need invoke other factors than gravity and
surface-action.</p></div>

A case which we have not specially considered,
but which may be found to deserve consideration in
biology, is that of a cell or drop suspended in a liquid
of <i>varying</i> density, for instance in the upper layers of
a fluid (e.g. sea-water) at whose surface condensation is
going on, so as to produce a steady density-gradient. In
this case the normally spherical drop will be flattened
into an oval form, with its
maximum surface-curvature lying at the level where the
densities of the drop and the surrounding liquid are just
equal. The sectional outline of the drop has been shewn to
be not a true oval or ellipse, but a somewhat complicated
quartic curve. (Rice, <i>Phil. Mag.</i> Jan. 1915.)</p></div>

The case of the snow-crystals is a

in some ways analogous to what we find, for instance, among
our microscopic skeletons of Radiolarians. That is to say,
we may one day meet with myriads of some one particular
form or species only, and another day with myriads of
another; while at another time and place we may find
species intermingled in inexhaustible variety. (Cf. e.g.

That the Foraminifera not only can but do hang
from the surface of the water is confirmed by the following
apt quotation which I owe to Mr E. Heron-Allen: “Quand on
place, comme il a été dit, le dépôt provenant du lavage
des fucus dans un flacon que l’on remplit de nouvelle
eau, on voit au bout d’une heure environ les animaux
[<i>Gromia dujardinii</i>] se mettre en mouvement et commencer
à grimper. Six heures après ils tapissent l’extérieur du
flacon, de sorte que les plus élevés sont à trente-six ou
quarante-deux millimetres du fond; le lendemain beaucoup
d’entre eux, <i>après avoir atteint le niveau du liquide,
ont continué à ramper à sa surface, en se laissant pendre
au-dessous</i> comme certains mollusques gastéropodes.”

This cellular pattern would seem to be related
to the “cohesion figures” described by Tomlinson in
various surface-films (<i>Phil. Mag.</i> 1861 to 1870); to the
“tesselated structure” in liquids described by Professor
James Thomson in 1882 (<i>Collected Papers</i>, p. 136); and to
the <i>tourbillons cellulaires</i> of Prof. H. Bénard (<i>Ann.
de Chimie</i> (7), <span class="smmaj">XXIII,</span> pp. 62–144, 1901, (8),
<span class="smmaj">XXIV,</span> pp. 563–566, 1911), <i>Rev. génér. des Sci.</i>
<span class="smmaj">XI,</span> p. 1268, 1900; cf. also E. H. Weber.
(<i>Poggend. Ann.</i>
<span class="smmaj">XCIV,</span> p. 452, 1855, etc.). The phenomenon is of
great interest and various appearances have been referred
to it, in biology, geology, metallurgy and even astronomy:
for the flocculent clouds in the solar photosphere shew
an analogous configuration. (See letters by Kerr Grant,
Larmor, Wager and others, in <i>Nature</i>, April 16 to June
11, 1914.) In many instances, marked by strict symmetry
or regularity, it is very possible that the interference
of waves or ripples may play its part in the phenomenon.
But in the majority of cases, it is fairly certain that
localised centres of action, or of diminished tension, are
present, such as might be provided by dust-particles in the
case of Darling’s experiment (cf. <i>infra</i>, p. 590).</p></div>

Certain palaeontologists (e.g. Haeusler and

plain smooth-shelled forms are the primitive and ancient
ones, and that the ribbed and otherwise ornamented shells
make their appearance at later dates in the course of
a definite evolution (cf. Rhumbler, <i>Foraminiferen der
Plankton-Expedition</i>, 1911, i, p. 21). If this were true it
would be of fundamental importance: but this book of mine

The presence or absence of the contractile

The first instance of what we now call an
adsorptive phenomenon was observed in soap-bubbles.
Leidenfrost, in 1756, was aware that the outer layer of
the bubble was covered by an “oily” layer. A hundred years
later Dupré shewed that in a soap-solution the soap tends
to concentrate at the surface, so that the surface-tension
of a very weak solution is very little different from that
of a strong one (<i>Théorie mécanique de la chaleur</i>, 1869,

Traube in particular has maintained that
in differences of surface-tension we have the origin of
the active force productive of osmotic currents, and
that herein we find an explanation, or an approach to an
explanation, of many phenomena which were formerly deemed
peculiarly “vital” in their character. “Die Differenz der
Oberflächenspannungen oder der Oberflächendruck eine Kraft
darstellt, welche als treibende Kraft der Osmose, an die
Stelle des nicht mit dem Oberflächendruck identischen
osmotischen Druckes, zu setzen ist, etc.” (Oberflächendruck

Soc.</i> <span class="smmaj">XXVIII,</span> p. 116, 1916), “If the surface film
of a colloid membrane separating two masses of fluid were
to change in such a way as to lower the potential of the
water in it, water would enter the region from both sides
at once. But if the change of state were to be propagated
as a wave of change, starting at one face and dying out at
the other face, water would be carried along from one side
of the membrane to the other. A succession of such waves
would maintain a flow of fluid.”</p></div>

The presence of this little liquid
“bourrelet,” drawn from the material of which the
partition-walls themselves are composed, is obviously
tending to a reduction of the internal surface-area. And it
may be that it is as well, or better, accounted for on this
ground than on Plateau’s assumption that it represents a
“surface of continuity.”</p></div>

A similar “bourrelet” is admirably seen at the
line of junction between a floating bubble and the liquid
on which it floats; in which case it constitutes a “masse
annulaire,” whose math­e­mat­i­cal properties and relation
to the form of the <i>nearly</i> hemispherical bubble, have
been investigated by van der Mensbrugghe (cf. Plateau,

Darwin had a somewhat similar idea, though
he allowed more play to the bee’s instinct or conscious
intention. Thus, when he noticed certain half-completed
cell-walls to be concave on one side and convex on the
other, but to become perfectly flat when restored for
a short time to the hive, he says: “It was absolutely
impossible, from the extreme thinness of the little plate,
that they could have effected this by gnawing away the
convex side; and I suspect that the bees in such cases
stand on opposite sides and push and bend the ductile and
warm wax (which as I have tried is easily done) into its
proper intermediate plane, and thus flatten it.”</p></div>

Von Fedorow had already described (in Russian)
the same figure, under the name of cubo-octahedron, or
hepta-parallelohedron, limited however to the case where
all the faces are plane. This figure, together with the
cube, the hexagonal prism, the rhombic dodecahedron and the
“elongated dodecahedron,” constituted the five plane-faced,
parallel-sided figures by which space is capable of being
completely filled and symmetrically partitioned; the
series so forming the foundation of Von Fedorow’s theory
of crystalline structure. The elongated dodecahedron is,
essentially, the figure of the bee’s cell.</p></div>

M. Robert (<i>l. c.</i> p. 305) has compiled a
long list of cases among the molluscs and the worms, where
the initial segmentation of the egg proceeds by equal or
unequal division. The two cases are about equally numerous.
But like many other writers, he would ascribe this equality
or inequality rather to a provision for the future than to
a direct effect of immediate physical causation: “Il semble
assez probable, comme on l’a dit souvent, que la plus
grande taille d’un blastomère est liée à l’importance et
au développement précoce des parties du corps qui doivent
en naître: il y aurait là une sorte de reflet des stades
postérieures du développement sur les premières phénomènes,
ce que M. Ray Lankester appelle <i>precocious segregation</i>.
Il faut avouer pourtant qu’on est parfois assez embarrassé
pour assigner une cause à pareilles différences.”</p></div>

The principle is well illustrated in an
experiment of Sir David Brewster’s (<i>Trans. R.S.E.</i>
<span class="smmaj">XXV,</span> p. 111, 1869). A soap-film is drawn over the
rim of a wine-glass, and then covered by a watch-glass.
The film is inclined or shaken till it becomes attached
to the glass covering, and it then immediately changes
place, leaving its transverse position to take up that of a
spherical segment extending from one side of the wine-glass
to its cover, and so enclosing the same volume of air as
formerly but with a great economy of surface, precisely
as in the case of our spherical partition cutting off one
corner of a cube.</p></div>

Such preconceptions as Rauber entertained

phenomena as he has faithfully depicted. Rauber had no idea

of surface-tension, or any other purely physical concept.
But he was deeply under the influence of Sachs’s rule of
rectangular intersection; and he was accordingly

In the following account I follow closely on
the lines laid down by Berthold; <i>Protoplasmamechanik</i>,
cap. vii. Many botanical phenomena identical and similar to
those here dealt with, are elaborately discussed by Sachs
in his <i>Physiology of Plants</i> (chap. xxvii, pp. 431–459,
Oxford, 1887); and in his earlier papers, Ueber die
Anordnung der Zellen in jüngsten Pflanzentheilen, and Ueber
Zellenanordnung und Wachsthum (<i>Arb. d. botan. Inst. Würzburg</i>,
1878, 1879). But Sachs’s treatment differs entirely from
that which I adopt and advocate here: his explanations
being based on his “law” of rectangular succession, and
involving complicated systems of confocal conics, with
their orthogonally intersecting ellipses and hyperbolas.</p></div>

(<i>Proc. R. S. E.</i> <span class="smmaj">XVI,</span> 1889, p.

The tube of Teredo shews no trace of organic
matter, but consists of irregular prismatic crystals: the
whole structure “being identical with that of small veins
of calcite, such as are seen in thin sections of rocks”
(Sorby, <i>Proc. Geol. Soc.</i> 1879, p. 58). This, then, would
seem to be a somewhat exceptional case of a shell laid
down completely outside of the animal’s external layer of
organic or colloid substance.</p></div>

In accordance with Emil Fischer’s conception
of “asymmetric synthesis,” it is now held to be more likely
that the process is synthetic than analytic: more likely,
that is to say, that the plant builds up from the first
one asymmetric body to the exclusion of the other, than
that it “selects” or “picks out” (as Japp supposed) the
right-handed or the left-handed molecules from an original,
optically inactive, mixture of the two; cf. A. McKenzie,

See for instance other excellent illustrations
in Carpenter’s article “Shell,” in Todd’s <i>Cyclopædia</i>,
vol. <span class="smmaj">IV.</span> pp. 550–571, 1847–49. According to
Carpenter, the shells of the mollusca (and also of
the crustacea) are “essentially composed of <i>cells</i>,
consolidated by a deposit of carbonate of lime in their
interior.” That is to say, Carpenter supposed that the
spherulites, or cal­co­sphe­rites of Harting, were, to
begin with, just so many living protoplasmic cells. Soon
afterwards however,
Huxley pointed out that the mode of formation,
while at first sight “irresistibly suggesting a cellular
structure,&#x200a;...&#x200a;is in reality nothing of the kind,” but “is
simply the result of the concretionary manner in which the
calcareous matter is deposited”; <i>ibid.</i> art. “Tegumentary
Organs,” vol. <span class="smmaj">V,</span> p. 487, 1859. Quekett (<i>Lectures
on Histology</i>, vol. <span class="smmaj">II,</span> p. 393, 1854, and <i>Q.
J. M. S.</i> <span class="smmaj">XI,</span> pp. 95–104, 1863) supported
Carpenter; but Williamson (Histological Features in the
Shells of the Crustacea, <i>Q. J. M. S.</i> <span class="smmaj">VIII,</span>
pp. 35–47, 1860) amply confirmed Huxley’s view, which
in the end Carpenter himself adopted (<i>The Microscope</i>,
1862, p. 604). A like controversy arose later in regard
to corals. Mrs Gordon (M. M. Ogilvie) asserted that the
coral was built up “of successive layers of calcified
cells, which hang together at first by their cell-walls,
and ultimately, as crystalline changes continue, form the
individual laminae of the skeletal structures” (<i>Phil.
Trans.</i> <span class="smmaj">CLXXXVII,</span> p. 102, 1896): whereas v.
Koch had figured the coral as formed out of a mass of
“Kalkconcremente” or “crystalline spheroids,” laid down
outside the ectoderm, and precisely similar both in their
early rounded and later polygonal stages (though von Koch
was not aware of the fact) to the cal­co­sphe­rites of Harting
(Entw. d. Kalkskelettes von Asteroides, <i>Mitth. Zool.
St. Neapel</i>, <span class="smmaj">III,</span> pp. 284–290, pl. <span class="smmaj">XX,</span>
1882). Lastly Duerden shewed that external to, and
apparently secreted by the ectoderm lies a homogeneous
organic matrix or membrane, “in which the minute calcareous
crystals forming the skeleton are laid down” (The Coral
<i>Siderastraea radians</i>, etc., <i>Carnegie Inst. Washington</i>,
1904, p. 34). Cf. also M. M. Ogilvie-Gordon, <i>Q. J. M. S.</i>

As a matter of fact, the phenomena associated
with the development of an “ocellus” are or may be of great
complexity, inasmuch as they involve not only a graded
distribution of pigment, but also, in “optical” coloration,
a symmetrical distribution of structure or form. The
subject therefore deserves very careful discussion, such as
Bateson gives to it (<i>Variation</i>, chap. xii). This, by the
way, is one of the very rare cases in which Bateson appears
inclined to suggest a purely physical explanation of an
organic phenomenon: “The suggestion is strong that the
whole series of rings (in <i>Morpho</i>) may have been formed
by some one central disturbance, somewhat as a series of
concentric waves may be formed by the splash of a stone
thrown into a pool, etc.”</p></div>

In an anomalous and very remarkable Australian
sponge, just described by Professor Dendy (<i>Nature</i>, May
18, 1916, p. 253) under the name of <i>Collosclerophora</i>,
the spicules are “gelatinous,” consisting of a gel of
colloid silica with a high percentage of water. It is not
stated whether an organic colloid is present together
with the silica. These gelatinous spicules arise as
exudations on the outer surface of cells, and come to lie
in intercellular spaces or vesicles.</p></div>

whose protoplasmic body is overlaid by a crust of
sponge-spicules, as “a psycho-physical individuality
whose experiments in self-expression include a masterly
treatment of sponge-spicules, and illustrate that organic
skill which came before the dawn of Art.” Sir Ray Lankester
finds it “not difficult to conceive of the existence of a
mechanism in the protoplasm of the Protozoa which selects
and rejects building-material, and determines the shapes of
the structures built, comparable to that mechanism which
is assumed to exist in the nervous system of insects and
other animals which ‘automatically’ go through wonderfully
elaborate series of complicated actions.” And he agrees
with “Darwin and others [who] have attributed the building
up of these inherited mechanisms to the age-long action of
Natural Selection, and the survival of those individuals
possessing qualities or ‘tricks’ of life-saving value,” <i>J.

Apart from the fact that the apex of each
pyramid is interrupted, or truncated, by the presence of
the little central cell, it is also possible that the solid
angles are not precisely equivalent to those of Maraldi’s
pyramids, owing to the fact that there is a certain amount
of distortion, or axial asymmetry, in the Nassellarian
system. In other words (to judge from Haeckel’s figures),
the tetrahedral symmetry in Nassellaria is not absolutely
regular, but has a main axis about which three of the
trihedral pyramids are symmetrical, the fourth having its
solid angle somewhat diminished.</p></div>

We need not go so far as to suppose that
the external layer of cells wholly lacked the power of
secreting a skeleton. In many of the Nassellariae figured
by Haeckel (for there are many variant forms or species
besides that represented here), the skeleton of the
partition-walls is very slightly and scantily developed. In
such a case, if we imagine its few and scanty strands to be
broken away, the central tetrahedral figure would be set
free, and would have all the appearance of a complete and
independent structure.</p></div>

was dealing, somewhat after the manner of Sir Thomas
Browne, with the mysteries of the quincunx, and also of
the hexagon; and was seeking for an explanation of the

It will be observed that here Moseley,
speaking as a mathematician and considering the <i>linear</i>
spiral, speaks of <i>whorls</i> when he means the linear
boundaries, or lines traced by the revolving radius
vector; while the conchologist usually applies the term
<i>whorl</i> to the whole space between the two boundaries. As
conchologists, therefore, we call the <i>breadth of a whorl</i>
what Moseley looked upon as the <i>distance between two
consecutive whorls</i>. But this latter nomenclature Moseley
himself often uses.</p></div>

<div class="dftnt">

In the case of Turbo, and all other
“turbinate” shells, we are dealing not with a plane
logarithmic spiral, as in Nautilus, but with a “gauche”
spiral, such that the radius vector no longer revolves
in a plane perpendicular to the axis of the system, but
is inclined to that axis at some constant angle (θ). The
figure still preserves its continued similarity, and may
with strict accuracy be called a logarithmic spiral in
space. It is evident that its envelope will be a right
circular cone; and indeed it is commonly spoken of as
a logarithmic spiral <i>wrapped upon a cone</i>, its pole
coinciding with the apex of the cone. It follows that the
distances of successive whorls of the spiral measured
on the same straight line passing through the apex of
the cone, are in geometrical progression, and conversely
just as in the former case. But the ratio between any two
consecutive interspaces (i.e. <span class="nowrap">
<i>R</i>&#xfeff;<sub>3</sub>&#x202f;−&#x202f;<i>R</i>&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub>&#x202f;&#x2044;&#x202f;<i>R</i>&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub>&#x202f;−&#x202f;<i>R</i>&#xfeff;<sub>1</sub>)</span>
is now equal to <span class="nowrap">
ε&#xfeff;<sup>2π&#x202f;sin&#x202f;θ&#x202f;cot&#x202f;α</sup>&#x202f;,</span>

semi-angle of the enveloping cone. (Cf. Moseley, <i>Phil.

As the successive increments evidently constitute
similar figures, similarly related to the pole (<i>P</i>), it
follows that their linear dimensions are to one another
as the radii vectores drawn to similar points in them:
for instance as
<span class="nowrap"><i>P&#x200a;P</i>&#xfeff;<sub>1</sub>&#x202f;,</span>
<span class="nowrap"><i>P&#x200a;P</i>&#xfeff;<sub>2</sub>&#x202f;,</span>

In Nautilus, the “hood” has somewhat different
dimensions in the two sexes, and these differences
are impressed upon the shell, that is to say upon its
“generating curve.” The latter constitutes a somewhat
broader ellipse in the
male than in the female. But this difference is not to be
detected in the young; in other words, the form of the
generating curve perceptibly alters with advancing age.
Somewhat similar differences in the shells of Ammonites
were long ago suspected, by D’Orbigny, to be due to sexual
differences. (Cf. Willey, <i>Natural Science</i>, <span class="smmaj">VI,</span>

Blake has remarked upon the fact (<i>op. cit.</i>
p. 248) that in some Cyrtocerata we may have a curved shell
in which the ornaments ap­prox­i­mate­ly run at a constant
angular distance from the pole, while the septa ap­prox­i­mate
to a radial direction; and that “thus one law of growth is
illustrated by the inside, and another by the outside.” In
this there is nothing at which we need wonder. It is merely
a case where the generating curve is set very obliquely
to the axis of the shell; but where the septa, which have
no necessary relation to the <i>mouth</i> of the shell, take
their places, as usual, at a certain definite angle to the
<i>walls</i> of the tube. This relation of the septa to the
walls of the tube arises after the tube itself is fully
formed, and the obliquity of growth of the open end of the
tube has no relation to the matter.</p></div>

In a few cases, according to Awerinzew and
Rhumbler, where the chambers are added on in concentric
series, as in Orbitolites, we have the crystalline
structure arranged radially in the radial walls but
tangentially in the concentric ones: whereby we tend
to obtain, on a minute scale, a system of orthogonal

It is obvious that the actual <i>outline</i> of a
foraminiferal, just as of a molluscan shell, may depart
widely from a logarithmic spiral. When we say here, for
short, that the shell <i>is</i> a logarithmic spiral, we merely
mean that it is essentially related to one: that it can
be inscribed in such a spiral, or that cor­re­spon­ding
points (such, for instance, as the centres of gravity of
successive chambers, or the extremities of successive
septa) wall always be found to lie upon such a spiral.</p></div>

As von Möller is careful to explain,
Naumann’s formula for the “cyclocentric conchospiral” is
appropriate to this and other spiral Foraminifera, since
we have in all these cases a central or initial chamber,
ap­prox­i­mate­ly spherical, about which the logarithmic spiral
is coiled (cf. Fig. <a href="#fig309" title="go to Fig. 309">309</a>). In species where the central
chamber is especially large, Naumann’s formula is all the
more advantageous. But it is plain that it is only required
when we are dealing with diameters, or with radii; so long
as we are merely comparing the breadths of <i>successive
whorls</i>, the two formulae come to the same thing.</p></div>

Hans Przibram asserts that the linear ratio

ap­prox­i­mate to 1·26, which

that the volumes of successive chambers tend to double.
This Przibram would bring into relation with another law,

to metamorphose, just when they double their weights,
or increase their linear dimensions in the ratio of
1&#x202f;:&#x202f;∛&#xfeff;2. (Die Kammerprogression der Foraminiferen als

In the case of Globigerina, some fourteen
species (out of a very much larger number of described
forms) were allowed by Brady (in 1884) to be distinct;
and this list has been, I believe, rather added to than
diminished. But these so-called species depend for the
most part on slight differences of degree, differences in
the angle of the spiral, in the ratio of magnitude of the
segments, or in their area of contact one with another.
Moreover with the exception of one or two “dwarf” forms,
said to be limited to Arctic and Antarctic waters, there is
no principle of geographical distribution to be discerned
amongst them. A species found fossil
in New Britain turns up in the North Atlantic: a species described from the West

In the case of the ram’s horn, the assumption
that the rings are annual is probably justified. In
cattle they are much less conspicuous, but are sometimes
well-marked in the cow; and in Sweden they are then called
“calf-rings,” from a belief that they record the number
of offspring. That is to say, the growth of the horn
is supposed to be retarded during gestation, and to be
accelerated after parturition, when superfluous nourishment
seeks a new outlet. (Cf. Lönnberg, <i>P.Z.S.</i>, p. 689, 1900.)</p></div>

The fact that in one very small deer, the
little South American Coassus, the antler is reduced
to a simple short spike, does not preclude the general
distinction which I have drawn. In Coassus we have the
beginnings of an antler, which has not yet manifested its
tendency to expand; and in the many allied species of the
American genus Cariacus, we find the expansion manifested
in various simple modes of ramification or bifurcation.

Mr Church’s whole theory, if it be not based
upon, is interwoven with, Sachs’s theory of the orthogonal
intersection of cell-walls, and the elaborate theories of
the symmetry of a growing point or apical cell which are
connected therewith. According to Mr Church, “the law of
the orthogonal intersection of cell-walls at a growing apex
may be taken as generally accepted” (p. 32); but I have
taken a very different view of Sachs’s law, in the eighth
chapter of the present book. With regard to his own and
Sachs’s hypotheses, Mr Church makes the following curious
remark (p. 42): “Nor are the hypotheses here put forward
more imaginative than that of the paraboloid apex of Sachs
which remains incapable of proof, or his construction
for the apical cell of Pteris which does not satisfy the
evidence of his own drawings.”</p></div>

after Father Bernard Lami, a contemporary of Newton’s,

it in connection with the form of the dodecahedron and
icosahedron, and with the ternary or quinary symmetry of

William Allman, Professor of Botany in Dublin (father of

tissue of the dicotyledons, or exogens, would be found to
consist of dodecahedra. and that of the monocotyledons or
endogens of icosahedra (<i>On the math­e­mat­i­cal connexion

In so far as our explanation involves a
shaping or moulding of the egg by the uterus or “oviduct”
(an agency supplemented by the proper tensions of the egg),
it is curious to note that this is very much the same as
that old view of Telesius regarding the formation of the
embryo (<i>De rerum natura</i>, <span class="smmaj">VI,</span> cc. 4 and 10), which
he had inherited from Galen, and of which Bacon speaks
(<i>Nov. Org.</i> cap. 50; cf. Ellis’s note). Bacon expressly
remarks that “Telesius should have been able to shew the
like formation in the shells of eggs.” This old theory of
embryonic modelling survives only in our usage of the term
“matrix” for a “mould.”</p></div>

Delight in beauty is one of the pleasures of
the imagination; there is no limit to its indulgence, and
no end to the results which we may ascribe to its exercise.
But as for the particular “standard of beauty” which the
bird (for instance) admires and selects (as Darwin says
in the <i>Origin</i>, p. 70, edit. 1884), we are very much in
the dark, and we run the risk of arguing in a circle: for
wellnigh all we can safely say is what Addison says (in the
412th <i>Spectator</i>)—that each different species “is most
affected with the beauties of its own kind&#x200a;....&#x200a;Hinc merula

free from difficulty. Twilight is apt to be short in the

In preparing or “macerating” a skeleton, the
naturalist nowadays carries on the process till nothing
is left but the whitened bones. But the old anatomists,
whose object was not the study of “comparative” morphology
but the wider theme of comparative physiology, were wont
to macerate by easy stages; and in many of their most
instructive preparations, the ligaments were intentionally
left in connection with the bones, and as part of the
“skeleton.”</p></div>

Our problem is analogous to Dr Thomas Young’s
problem of the best disposition of the timbers in a wooden

In like manner, Clerk Maxwell could not help
employing the term “skeleton” in defining the math­e­mat­i­cal
conception of a “frame,” constituted by points and their
interconnecting lines: in studying the equi­lib­rium of
which, we consider its different points as mutually acting
on each other with forces whose directions are those of the
lines joining each pair of points. Hence (says Maxwell),
“in order to exhibit the mechanical action of the frame in
the most elementary manner, we may draw it as a <i>skeleton</i>,
in which the different points are joined by straight lines,
and we may indicate by numbers attached to these lines the
tensions or compressions in the cor­re­spon­ding pieces of
the frame” (<i>Trans. R. S. E.</i> <span class="smmaj">XXVI,</span> p. 1, 1870).
It follows that the diagram so constructed represents a
“diagram of forces,” in this limited sense that it is
geometrical as regards the position and direction of the
forces, but arithmetical as regards their magnitude. It is
to just such a diagram that the animal’s skeleton tends to
ap­prox­i­mate.</p></div>

When the jockey crouches over the neck

Driesch sees in “Entelechy” that something
which differentiates the whole from the sum of its parts
in the case of the organism: “The organism, we know, is
a system the single constituents of which are inorganic
in themselves; only the whole constituted by them in
their typical order or arrangement owes its specificity
to ‘Entelechy’&#x200a;” (<i>Gifford Lectures</i>, p. 229, 1908): and
I think it could be shewn that many other philosophers
have said precisely the same thing. So far as the argument
goes, I fail to see how <i>this</i> Entelechy is shewn to
be peculiarly or specifically related to the <i>living</i>
organism. The conception that the whole is <i>always</i>
something very different from its parts is a very ancient
doctrine. The reader will perhaps remember how, in another
vein, the theme is treated by Martinus Scriblerus: “In
every Jack there is a <i>meat-roasting</i> Quality, which
neither resides in the fly, nor in the weight, nor in any
particular wheel of the Jack, but is the result of the
whole composition; etc., etc.”</p></div>

In this there lies a certain justification
for a saying of Minot’s, of the greater part of which,
nevertheless, I am heartily inclined to disapprove. “We
biologists,” he says, “cannot deplore too frequently or too
emphatically the great math­e­mat­i­cal delusion by which men
often of great if limited ability have been misled into
becoming advocates of an erroneous conception of accuracy.
The delusion is that no science is accurate until its
results can be expressed math­e­mat­i­cally. The error comes
from the assumption that mathematics can express complex
relations. Unfortunately mathematics have a very limited
scope, and are based upon a few extremely rudimentary
experiences, which we make as very little children and
of which no adult has any recollection. The fact that
from this basis men of genius have evolved wonderful
methods of dealing with numerical relations should not
blind us to another fact, namely, that the observational
basis of mathematics is, psychologically speaking, very
minute compared with the observational basis of even a
single minor branch of biology&#x200a;....&#x200a;While therefore here
and there the math­e­mat­i­cal methods may aid us, <i>we need
a kind and degree of accuracy of which mathematics is
absolutely incapable</i>&#x200a;....&#x200a;With human minds constituted as
they actually are, we cannot anticipate that there will
ever be a math­e­mat­i­cal expression for any organ or even a
single cell, although formulae will continue to be useful
for dealing now and then with isolated details...” (<i>op.
cit.</i>, p. 19, 1911). It were easy to discuss and criticise
these sweeping assertions, which perhaps had their origin
and parentage in an <i>obiter dictum</i> of Huxley’s, to the
effect that “Mathematics is that study which knows nothing
of observation, nothing of experiment,
nothing of induction, nothing of causation” (<i>cit.</i> Cajori,
<i>Hist of Elem. Mathematics</i>, p. 283). But Gauss called
mathematics “a science of the eye”; and Sylvester assures
us that “most, if not all, of the great ideas of modern
mathematics have had their origin in observation” (<i>Brit.
Ass. Address</i>, 1869, and <i>Laws of Verse</i>, p. 120, 1870).</p></div>

This significance is particularly remarkable
in connection with the development of speed, for the
metacarpal region is the seat of very important leverage
in the propulsion of the body. In the Museum of the Royal
College of Surgeons in Edinburgh, there stand side by
side the skeleton of an immense carthorse (celebrated for
having drawn all the stones of the Bell Rock Lighthouse
to the shore), and a beautiful skeleton of a racehorse,
which (though the fact is disputed) there is good reason to
believe is the actual skeleton of Eclipse. When I was a boy
my grandfather used to point out to me that the cannon-bone
of the little racer is not only relatively, but actually,
longer than that of the great Clydesdale.</p></div>

It was these very drawings of Dürer’s that
gave to Peter Camper his notion of the “facial angle.”
Camper’s method of comparison was the very same as ours,
save that he only drew the axes, without filling in the
network, of his coordinate system; he saw clearly the
essential fact, that the skull <i>varies as a whole</i>,
and that the “facial angle” is the index to a general
deformation. “The great object was to shew that natural
differences might be reduced to rules, of which the
direction of the facial line forms the <i>norma</i> or canon;
and that these directions and inclinations are always
accompanied by correspondent form, size and position of
the other parts of the cranium,” etc.; from Dr T. Cogan’s
preface to Camper’s work <i>On the Connexion between the
Science of Anatomy and the Arts of Drawing, Painting and
Sculpture</i> (1768?), quoted in Dr R. Hamilton’s Memoir of
Camper, in <i>Lives of Eminent Naturalists</i> (<i>Nat. Libr.</i>),
Edin. 1840.</p></div>

The co-ordinate system of Fig. <a href="#fig382" title="go to Fig. 382">382</a> is somewhat
different from that which I drew and published in my former
paper. It is not unlikely that further in­ves­ti­ga­tion will
further simplify the comparison, and shew it to involve a
still more symmetrical system.</p></div>

Cf. W. B. Scott (<i>Amer. Journ. of Science</i>,

mammalian series at all complete, such as that of the
horses, is remarkably continuous, and that the progress
of discovery is steadily filling up what few gaps remain.
So closely do successive stages follow upon one another
that it is sometimes extremely difficult to arrange them
all in order, and to distinguish clearly those members
which belong in the main line of descent, and those which
represent incipient branches. Some phylogenies actually
suffer from an embarrassment of riches.”</p></div>

on Human Skeletons, p. 86, 1886: “I gather both from my

range of variation in the relative length and breadth of
the scapula is very considerable in the same race, so that
it needs a large number of bones to enable one to obtain an
accurate idea of the mean of the race.”</p></div>

There is a paper on the math­e­mat­i­cal study
of organic forms and organic processes by the learned
and celebrated Gustav Theodor Fechner, which I have only
lately read, but which would have been of no little use
and help to our argument had I known it before. (Ueber
die mathematische Behandlung organischer Gestalten und
Processe, <i>Berichte d. k. sächs. Gesellsch.</i>, <i>Math.-phys.
Cl.</i>, Leipzig, 1849, pp. 50–64.) Fechner’s treatment is
more purely math­e­mat­i­cal and less physical in its scope and
bearing than ours, and his paper is but a short one; but
the conclusions to which he is led differ little from our
own. Let me quote a single sentence which, together with
its context, runs precisely on the lines of the discussion
with which this chapter of ours began. “So ist also die
mathematische Bestimmbarkeit im Gebiete des Organischen
ganz eben so gut vorhanden als in dem des Unorganischen,
und in letzterem eben solchen oder äquivalenten
Beschränkungen unterworfen als in ersterem; und nur sofern
die unorganischen Formen und das unorganische Geschehen
sich einer einfacheren Gesetzlichkeit mehr nähern als die
organischen, kann die Approximation im unorganischen Gebiet
leichter und weiter getrieben werden als im organischen.
Dies wäre der ganze, sonach rein relative, Unterschied.”
Here in a nutshell, in words written some seventy years
ago, is the gist of the whole matter.</p>

<p>An interesting little book of Schiaparelli’s (which I ought
to have known long ago)—<i>Forme organiche naturali e forme
geometriche pure</i>, Milano, Hoepli, 1898—has likewise come
into my hands too late for discussion.</p></div>

<div class="transnote">TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE

<p>Original spelling and grammar have been generally retained,
with some exceptions noted below. Original printed page numbers
are shown like this: {52}. Footnotes have been renumbered 1–663
and relocated to the end of the book, ahead of the Index. The
transcriber produced the cover image and hereby assigns it to
the public domain. Original page images are available from
archive.org—search for<br /> “ongrowthform1917thom”.</p>

<p>Some tables and illustrations have been moved from their
original locations within paragraphs of text to nearby
locations between paragraphs. This includes, for example,
the full-page table printed on page 67, which page number
is removed from these ebook editions. Some other tables
and illustrations have been left where they originally
lay, in the middle of paragraphs of text.</p>

<p>Some, but not all ditto
marks, including “do.”, have been
eliminated. Enlarged curly brackets {&#x202f;} turned
horizontal, used as graphic devices to
combine information in two or more columns of a table, have
been eliminated. Enlarged curly brackets used as
graphic devices to suggest combination of information over two
or more lines of text, have been eliminated. For example, on
page <a href="#p075" title="go to pg. 75">75</a>, in the last column of the table, two lengths, 490 and
500, were printed, the latter under the former, with a large
right curly bracket combining them. The transcriber has changed
that construction to “490–500”, taking the original to mean a
range.</p>

<ul>
<li><p class="pfirst">
Page <a href="#p106" title="go to pg. 106">106</a>.
Changed “it we could believe” to “if we could believe”.</p></li>

<li><p class="pfirst">
Page <a href="#p107" title="go to pg. 107">107</a>.
Changed “(m.)” to “(mm.)”, in column 3 of the table.</p></li>

Both “<i>Q</i>&#xfeff;<sub>10</sub>” and

appear on the page as originally printed.</p></li>

<li><p class="pfirst">

Perhaps, the original “The area of the enlarged

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to
date contact information can be found at the Foundation's web site and
official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
